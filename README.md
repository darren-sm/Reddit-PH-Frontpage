# Reddit Front Page Web Scraping and Data Visualization

This project is divided into two parts: Web Scraping and Data Visualization. It would first gather the popular posts in reddit front page for Philippine users. The data will then be stored in a JSON flat file which will be visualized in the other Jupyter Notebook file.

### Web Scraping

Web scraping is also divided into two parts. The first part's purpose is to list out the popular posts in Philippines. What we'll get here are the links for the post.  Unfortunately, there is no API for this yet. So what I did is to send requests with proxy rotation to exceed the set limitations of bot requests
