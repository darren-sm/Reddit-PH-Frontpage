Sometimes this includes seemingly spontaneous 4th wall breaking interactions with a crew who serve as an unofficial supporting cast for their show. That way its less off putting and jarring when they start talking about their products and services in the middle of the show in a fake casual way, and it doesn't feel like they're just shilling.",

        "text": "I'm logical, the manager of NA DPC div 2 team American goons, and through a series of unfortunate misunderstandings we've just been **Disqualified from this DPC season and banned(?) from ALL future PGL events**. This means that we have almost no tournaments to play for the next 6 months as this is our last opportunity to get a slot in the DPC to play TI qualifiers.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nContext: We're an NA team with notable players (boris, esK, Lil_Nick, Giant and pingu) and no slot, so we're trying to qualify for the DPC from open qualifiers. We won open qualifiers with few issues and made it to closed qualifiers. We won our closed qualifier games until the upper bracket finals where we lost 2-0 to GRIN esports. GRIN is a solid team and it took us 54 minutes to beat them in open qualifiers. We're a Division 2 NA team and we're inconsistent. We got crushed in lanes game 1 and game 2 we just got outplayed. FYI, GRIN won 2-0 against Fart Studios in the upper bracket. **When we played against GRIN, we had no idea who we would be playing in the lower bracket finals as the match to determine our opponent had not been played yet.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nAfter our upper bracket loss, we won our final match against GateKept to secure our spot in the DPC. Everyone kind of knows each other in this scene and Napkin and AlienManaBanana (two of the GateKept players) messaged our players asking how or why we lost to GRIN because they believed us to be the better team. Our players jokingly said that we lost so that we'd **GATEKEEP** them. Here are the full chatlogs of both of the interactions:\n \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096582294933868597/1111373125578391582/image.png\n \n \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1108223720331415592/1111121895354531930/image.png.\n \nWe are committed to fair play and would never compromise our competitive integrity by intentionally gatekeeping a team from the DPC in such a petty manner. Regardless, the GateKept players went forward and submitted these messages to the PGL admins. **The investigation was held overnight and had concluded by the following morning.** When we woke up, we were informed by the PGL admins that we had been disqualified.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FIjXyhC.png\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nWe tried to talk to the admin team to explain that it was a misunderstanding, but after limited reponse they did not seem eager to have a conversation. Our request for evidence showing that we lost on purpose has not been fulfilled. All we have been told is that one of our players said that we lost the games intentionally.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nWhat we said, though very common in DOTA, could be construed at most as in bad taste, but getting disqualified over a private chat message with no proof of match-fixing doesn't make sense. The \"evidence\" is private messages between two players who have established rapport (esK and Napkin were DPC teammates and AlienManaBanana and Lil_Nick had played third-party tournaments together earlier this year). [Aui_2000 reviewed our matches and concluded that we were \"playing to win.\"](https://twitter.com/Aui_2000/status/1662028253630963712?s=20) **Furthermore the people who are pushing for our disqualification are the same people who would receive our slot if we are disqualified.** THIS IS A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nWe appreciate PGL doing their due diligence, but with this new information, we hope that this decision can be overturned.\n \n**All players and personnel involved in this situation from the side of American goons swear that they have never match-fixed.**\n\nThank you to everyone showing support on the Reddit and Twitter threads. It has been truly humbling and inspiring seeing the community band together for this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTagging u/JeffHill so that Valve might see this\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***UPDATE:PGL OVERTURNED THE DECISION https://twitter.com/pglesports/status/1662264692784390144***",

Next you decided to release something only at a specific show, but then announce after fans wait in insane line ups all day to get their hands on something that you are releasing \u2018limited edition\u2019 digital version\u2026 what? How can something digital be limited?Also btw they already own most of the songs on that CD. Put the three songs up on iTunes and let it be. This is so ridiculous. \nYour merch is also GARBAGE material and falling apart after one wash when you are almost a billionaire. International shipping is insane.\nAlso my car doesn\u2019t even have a CD player, Taylor.",

Even if di ka gagamit ng wired earphones when streaming lossless format, the difference in quality is still noticeable compared to Spotify since they are limited to 320 kbps lang. You get to listen to your favorite artists' music the way they intended it to be heard, you can disable the vocals at magiging instrumental lang yung song for your karaoke sessions, at may spatial audio pa which tracks the movement of your head to give an illusion of a surround sound system when using airpods. Yes, pwede mo i-on yung spatial audio ng phone mo at buksan ang Spotify, pero ang difference is gimmicky yung sa Spotify dahil hindi naman designed for spatial audio yung files nila.

            "Actually, kapag airpods or anything wireless, technically hindi na sya lossless dahil may compression na nagaganap, but still the quality is verrrry noticeable dahil nga mababa quality ng Spotify. So the best way to listen talaga is through a pair of wired earphones. Doesn't have to be from Apple. \nRegarding spatial audio, yea it's for airpods and beats headphones lang since kelangan ng h1 chip for head tracking. But still, on a normal earphone, you'll hear a wider soundstage, hindi muddy, rinig mo kada instrument.",

It wasn't so bad immediately, I just knew I got hit. It hurt for like 15 minutes after, especially when moving. It's always a lingering pain. Some soreness followed for a couple days after, but that was completely tolerable.\nSuffice it to say, I wouldn't want that to happen again. Definitely the worst place I've been hit in playing airsoft. It was so extremely unlucky too, as I was actually wearing a crotch protector, but because of the way I was positioned, there was a small gap to the side. \nThe second worst was the nail on my left ring finger, not wearing gloves.

Even when decisions are locked, appeals should be possible. \nOther Sports leagues permit appeals, and work to only make public their decisions after these processes have run their course- this, coupled with a release of the underlying accusation and evidence to at least some trusted neutral third parties, if not just freely available, would make it much less likely that future bans are controversial.",

Paragon did it's own investigation and even those amount of evidence was not sufficient to 100% confirm match fixing. They reviewed correspondence (couldn't trust those 100%),they reviewed every second of gameplay and cannot prove intentional throwing. So, nobody was banned. Only Lefitan was banned by his org for using 3rd party assistant software in non-Valve event. But this was proved by a discord recording provided by the org. A year ago 10 players were banned for account sharing, but this was because an insider provided hard evidence.\nThe hard evidence for match fixing should be, imo, a combination of:\n\nabnormal odds shift;\nclear throwing incident at the same time period as reviewed per game play;\na testimony from an insider with some proof of actual bet (screenshot, recording);\na confirmation from betting company, that this bet did exist (as screenshots from sites can be HTML edited to look real, or photoshopped).\n",

Klee doesn't work in vaporise comps, which is the sole reason why pyro was meta for a while. With a kit that works against vaporise, her damage ceiling is much lower than Hu Tao. Klee is a catalyst-user, which on its own already means clunky gameplay due to high stamina charge atk cost, long animations, etc. Hu Tao on the other hand, has an E skill that makes her charge atk super fast with no ICD. Even without animation cancelling, she can easily dish out damage on par with vape diluc (at C0 dragonbane). \nTl;dr cancelling attacks brings Klee from weak to viable, and Hu Tao from good to semi-meta.\n\n\n^ at C0 dragon bane, she matches vape diluc easily with the same investment. Not great, but definitely not \"useless as hell\"\n\n\nInvesting in artifacts and weapons is a baseline for any carry. A good Hu Tao team only needs Hu Tao max invested and Xingqiu semi-invested. She has equivalent investment levels to any other meta teams that isn't bloom-focused. Every other meta team (xiangling teams, hypercarry, freeze, aggravate, xingqiu-yelan, taser, etc) requires the same, if not more investment.\n\n",

She basically only needs XQ in the comp, allowing you to swap in for damage/utility characters to make a viable team as needed.\nYou're entitled to your opinion, of course, but Hu Tao hits like a truck with minimal investment.",

            "I wonder how many people there are that would use Dolphin if it were on Steam, but not otherwise. Steam deck users who don\u2019t want to take those extra steps I guess",
            "I did ask a similar question of the difference between downloading it from steam than the official site and the response is either for the Steam Deck and cloud saves.",
            "Playing  with friends via remote play is my reason.",
            "Same. I have Retroarch on Steam and use remote play together to do SNES/N64/PS1 multiplayer games with my friends. It's just so easy, only requires one person to have Retroarch installed/have copies of the games, and works pretty damn perfectly(Mileage may vary depending on netspeed, I have 2 gig Fiber). \nWe were looking forward to Dolphin on Steam to do the same with GameCube games. Sure, we could play together with standalone and some fiddling, but it really is just the ease of use.",
            "Lol what extra steps. It's almost faster to use emudeck, and you get like all the emulators at the same time",
            "Yup, there's no reason to download dolphin on steamdeck. Emudeck has all the emulators, and you can launch your games and make a custom portrait for the game on your home screen",
            "Actually quite a lot.\nPeople still dont understand that Piracy is not a financial issue, its a convenience issue.\nIf your game runs worse because of piracy protection like Denuvo, if your game is difficult to access or runs badly because its only listed on an inferior Store like the Epic Games Store, if your game is \"online only\" with no real online component, all of that poses a convenience issue.\nSo people will use emulators.\nIt can be seen with the movie and music industry even better, if you need 6 subscriptions to watch the 6 shows you want, people dont want to bother with it, so they just stream it on grey sites and just not pay at all.\nIn comparison when most of the streaming was consolidated on Netflix for a decent price everyone and their mother and grandparents had a Netflix account.\nNow people get fed up with having to either shift their subscriptions around or just not subscribe at all.\nEmulators fill a void for people that cant be bothered to deal with the bullshit of some companies, but so far they have a barrier of entry due to the initial setup that requires some expertise.\nOnce its on Steam it would be much more easily accessible and potentially even automatically installed and setup, so the barrier of entry lowers and emulations becomes more mainstream.\nNintendo is afraid of that because they have the most to lose. The Nintendo systems have the lowest tech requirements and the worst \"walled garden\" setup where their games are exclusive to their systems often with no backwards compatibility.\nXbox and Sony also have some to lose but not nearly as much as Nintendo.",
            "Well, Valve is not a group of modders that can be bankrupted just on legal fees.\nNext time they will try to DMCA google to not put links to webs with nintendo emulators?",
            "Valve is at zero risk of being sued by Nintendo in this situation, but the open source developers of the emulator could put themselves at risk of being sued. In this context, Valve is an online service provider who hosts games / software developed by other parties. When an online service provider receives a DMCA notice, they are required to take down the content that is allegedly in violation and notify the creator of the content. Then, the creator of the content has the option to either dispute the claim or accept it. If they dispute the claim, then the party who made the claim has 2 weeks to sue the creator. If the creator does not get sued after 2 weeks, then the provider may repost the content, and if the creator does get sued, then they have to win in court in order for the content to go back up.\nSo, in this case, Valve is merely a facilitator. Currently, the developers of the emulator have to decide to either accept that their emulator can not be on Steam or dispute the claim, which could lead to them being sued by Nintendo.",
            "I'm not sure the DMCA applies in this case as its verbiage is specifically applied to publishers of user submitted media which violates an alleged copyright.\nWhile it could be argued a video game is media, dolphin is both not \"media\" in a conventional sense, it also does not as a matter of preexisting case law threaten Nintendo's copyright.\nDMCA takedowns are a mechanism designed to enable platforms which autonomously publish user submissions to avoid liability for the content of said submission, which is why on very large platforms this tends to be used very aggressively.\nIn this case however Valve excercises direct control over the curation of every new product that appears on steam before it is on the platform, and as a result knows full well that they are directly implicated.\nGiven the context of dolphin, a well known emulator, it is almost inconceivable that copyright issues were not evaluated before it went up, and as a result it seems unlikely Valve would choose to comply with a takedown to me.",
            "It is really a grey area and this is a great post. It isn't explicitly rules against, but I learned the hard way that you don't want to be one of the first prosecutions for something everybody else was doing.\nI wager that Valve caves and it just draws more attention to Dolphin, as Nintendo loves the Streisand Effect.",
            ">I learned the hard way that you don't want to be one of the first prosecutions for something everybody else was doing\nThis\u2026 sounds like a possible story here.",
            "Especially if Nintendo is involved. They'll garnish your wages for the rest of your life.",
            "Nintendo is very petty. They'd rather destroy people's lives just to prove a point. And will absolutely hold those people to it. Nintendo does some good things, but they are incredibly draconian and protective when it comes to their content, at all costs. And they have the money to throw around.",
            "Well, no, it isn't a gray area at all. \nSony made damn sure of that, if by accident, in their (mostly successful) attempts to destroy Bleem. While they successfully bankrupted the company through legal fees, Emulators were deemed legal in the results of the lawsuit itself. \nAnd Bleem was being sold for money and on Dreamcast. Which is much more egregious than Dolphin's free Steam distribution on PCs. \nEmulators are 100% legal, so long as they don't use official code.",
            "Emulation is not preventable by copyright, so long as they aren\u2019t distributing ROMs or the system\u2019s software.",
            ">I learned the hard way\nI'm gonna grab a blanket and a snack. I wanna hear about this when I get back.",
            "Im buying it now for sure. Im tired of overstep. I really dont really play emulator games myself but buying could pay for lawyers who will protect the average consumer like me in other ways.  These mega corporations just love intimidating people, i think its time the pendulum swings the other way",
            "It\u2019s free. \nThere\u2019s probably somewhere to donate though.",
            "It does seem likely to me that the section of the DMCA covering liability protections for online service providers shouldn't apply because of Valve's direct curation of their content. But regardless, Nintendo sent them a DMCA takedown request anyways and Valve seems to have complied seeing as they've indefinitely delayed the release of Dolphin on Steam, taken Dolphin's product page down on Steam, and formally notified the developers of Dolphin of the DMCA takedown. \nI think it's probably in Valve's best interest as a business to keep going along with the DMCA process because Nintendo is currently treating them as if they are not liable for the software they distribute. If Valve were to argue the DMCA does not apply in this situation and start distributing Dolphin, then they would be risking a lawsuit from Nintendo over distributing software which primarily serves to circumvent a technical protection measure protecting copyrighted material, which if proven would constitute a violation of (a totally different provision of) the DMCA.",
            "Thanks for the update. Haven't been following this closely. Be interesting to see how this shakes out for sure.",
            "DMCA also applies to circumvention tools. That's probably what Nintendo would try to argue for.",
            ">DMCA also applies to circumvention tools\nSony v Connectix says otherwise as it ruled that \"circumvention tools\", as you say, were \"modestly transformative\" so falls under fair use\nBoth Sony v Connectix and Sega v Accolade also ruled that it is within your rights to copy code if the purpose was to reverse engineer it.",
            "From how I understand it they don't really have a choice but to comply with the DMCA notice and pass it along to the game publisher (in this case dolphin). \nOtherwise they risk losing their safe harbor provisions and would end up being liable for any copyright infringement hosted on their platform, and while they are careful about what gets published I doubt they check every asset, texture, music, etc used in games is properly licensed",
            ">careful about what gets published\nThey arnt very careful. It's very easy to put a game up on steam, they barely check it.",
            "One small mistake could change things though, so Valve would really need to be on the balls. Any picture with a Nintendo logo or Nintendo game, any reference to Nintendo's trademarks, anything that would help people get encryption keys in a bad way, etc.  \nThere's a bunch of videos from actual lawyers going over the details in other similar cases. The line is really, really thin, and Nintendo knows very well where that line is.",
            "Nintendos Lawyers literally DMCA took down their own, official, nintendo twitter over Tears of the Kingdom.\nI wouldnt trust Nintendo or their Lawyers to know shit but \"We say this is the law, so its the law, obey us!\"",
            "I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall during the conversations that happened at Nintendo after that!",
            "Wait what happened?",
            "They sued themselves.",
            "Nintendo has DMCA'd themselves multiple times in the past. I'm not sure I'd say they know or even care where the line actually is.",
            "Yeah its probably an interesting day for Valve's legal team.  \nOn one hand there's a strong case to keep it up, and a theoretical slight benefit for valve in the form of moat building similar to google giving away android for free or meta publishing its LLM stuff open source to legally supress competition by eroding an inaccessible market for free.\nOn the other hand, they're dealing with the famously litigious Nintendo here, a company known for pursuing even the most minor of legal issues to the bitter end and might decide its not worth the trouble given Nintendo's only tertiary effect on their business and the otherwise null income a free piece of software would generate.\nThen again Gabe Newell has been known to make value judgements, like Steam's stance on NFTs based on a reading of industry trends and a general vision for how he wants steam to evolve its place in the industry and I know Valve hasn't been attracting as many publishers in the non-game software space so taking a hard stance on this one could be good optics that attract other paid small apps to steam.",
            "Well the developer already announced that they postponed the release.\nSo I guess Nintendo won this round.\nValve seems to not take any side here and let the developer fight it out with Nintendo. So this seems like a closed door hung for now. The developer isn\u2019t going to spend their life saving on fighting Nintendo in court.",
            "Too bad the files already exist for dolphin, and its not like they're releasing new wii titles. Why is Nintendo the goddamn worst...",
            "Nintendo already tried and failed to shut down emulation. Several times. The case would likely be dismissed. This is just another attempt to cause pain in the hope to frustrate people to the point that they stop. It is disgusting and a clear abuse of power.",

            "Shhh, don't give them ideas.",
            "I would love to see a legal fight between Nintendo and Google",
            "For all their many, many faults, Google via YouTube have historically been fairly tolerant of, let's call them \"third party tools\".  They allowed, for example, Vanced to operate largely unopposed for years until Vanced got greedy and tried to pull a cash-grab with some NFT nonsense (see edit). A month later, after five years of operation, YouTube flipped the proverbial \"kill-switch\" and  Vanced quietly shut down.\nNow, I'll be the first to admit that corelation doesn't imply causation, but I also don't typically believe in coincidences when it comes to Google and their legal team either, so you'll have to decide for yourself what happened.  I'll also say that there are several other apps and extensions like Vanced that are still operating (as free services) to this day. \nWhich is a roundabout and only barely coherent way of saying, I'd LOVE to see Google inadvertently fight for digital ownership rights.\nedit\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/google-shuts-down-youtube-vanced-a-popular-ad-blocking-android-app/\n>Just last month, Team Vanced pulled a provocative stunt involving minting a non-fungible token of the Vanced logo, and there's solid speculation that this action is what drew Google's ire. Google mostly tends to leave the Android modding community alone, but profiting off your legally dubious mod is sure to bring out the lawyers.",
            ">Vanced got greedy and tried to pull a cash-grab with some NFT nonsense.\nWow... I did not know that. I'd say Vanced deserved what came to them then, even though it really sucked for me when that happened. It definitely seem like Google has indeed been monitoring all these 3rd party tools but doesn't really take any action until the a certain line has been crossed.",
            "That\u2019s usually the case to begin with. Piracy in general is as big as it is because the legal stuff isn\u2019t worth the hassle until some schmuck comes around and tries to profit off of it. It\u2019s why you pretty much only ever hear about Nintendo making a scene about it because Japan in general takes copywriting laws very seriously and they\u2019re also a very old generation company, and then with watchable media it\u2019s basically only ever directors using it as a way to vent instead of actually trying to do something. \nThey fought the battles for it a decade ago, realized it wasn\u2019t something winnable and not worth the effort, and just shrug it off. But then anytime someone puts a name and a face to whatever project it is by making money, it\u2019s a very quick and easy winnable battles. That\u2019s why so many hosting sites just accept donations instead of having a paywall or straight up charging, there\u2019s no \u201cprofiting\u201d from donations",

Bleem! did not support loading ROM ISOs, only reading a disc drive directly, which probably helped their case in that regard.\nI don't consider it a coincidence that within a generation all consoles switched to media that couldn't be read by most PCs, forcing emulators to rely on ROM images alone.\nPlus the DMCA and it's \"anti-circumvention\" stuff did not exist then. Circumvention was considered essential for bleem! to be a viable competitor so the court ruled they were allowed to do so. New laws override court rulings. I don't know if that would apply here though.

They aren't claiming that the emulator violates their copyright (if that were the case, then they wouldn't have a case), they're claiming that the emulator violates a provision of the DMCA which prohibits circumventing technological measures that control access to copyrighted works. Their argument is that the emulator circumvents an encryption on ROMs that was intended to protect the copyrighted games.",

The original nes version, the SNES release, the gba version for my kids, the eShop version on the Wii and then a monthly subscription of their crappy service on the switch.  If I want to emulate, I should effing be allowed.  You've made your money on it.  And doesn't Nintendo have something like 25 years of operating costs in the bank?  They're like one of the only fiscally responsible companies on the planet where they could post a decade of losses and still be in the black.  If they keep trying to kill all these fan projects all in the name of getting a few more $5 purchases, I'll just stop buying their stuff all together.",

It's also not clear if the exact same set of facts applies here.\nThat's assuming Valve even wanted to oppose them on this, which they may not.",

Distribution of pirated software is one thing, but unless I\u2019m misinformed or something has changed since, they would be fine as long as they didn\u2019t endorse any rom sites, correct?",
            "Wasn't Nintendo also responsible for disabling the \"easy way\" to run emulators in retail mode on the XBOX Series consoles?\nThey can't stop emulators but they can target platforms, especially when the platforms make it trivial to emulate their IPs. Which is shameful when so much gaming history will get lost forever due to bad ports or worse, no way at all to experience these older titles.\nThey probably don't look at people sitting at their desks running an emulator the same as someone running their games on the TV (via XBOX) or handheld (Steamdeck, Skyline emulator)",
            "Nintendo moment\nThere should be a law that forbids you from making DMCA claims for bullshit reasons, you should have to prove in court that it infringes on your copyright before anything happens. \nAlso if DMCA claim is deemed fradulent you instantly lose all your copyright and cant get new ones for the rest of eternity\nWe should honestly do a copyright reset,\nall current copyright goes public domain\nand anything new lasts maximum of 10 years and corporations cannot own copyright\nBut nothing like this is gonna happen because for some reason politicians are still allowed to have connections to corporations.",
            "I wonder how much money they've spent on emulator legal proceedings and DMCAs over the years. Because I can guarantee they could 10x whatever that number is in profits instead if they'd just support their old games and consoles respectfully. \nFans are doing this stuff because they love your games, not because they want them for free.\nIt blows my mind that their response has always been to spend money on this problem in a way that offers them absolutely no return and negative PR at the same time."

In his interviews he usually is pretty blunt about knowing what him being up there could mean but also why they do it that way. \nSeems like he knows the risks and also what the responsibilities are if the risks don't pan out. \nI mean, he's probably also an adrenaline junky, but that's not all of it.",

It forces the two primary pick and roll defenders to defend that area of the court without help since nobody is close enough to get there, and once you do that they\u2019re leaving either the three wide open or the roll to the basket wide open. It\u2019s a tool used to set up the highest efficiency shots, but people only recognize the shots that come after.",

            "His 3 point shooting woes were over stated / people didn\u2019t acknowledge his improvement there to end his final season with the Nets. \nOutside of that, he\u2019s great at the rim, operates the short roll better than the large majority of the league, and can handle the ball fine enough to initiate an offense.",
            "Definitely needs to get the bag this year. Definitely should be paid more than DLo at least.",

            "We unfortunately can\u2019t. But his options aren\u2019t all that great so maybe he sticks around another year. \nThis might be his one chance to absolutely get PAID and if that chance comes in he absolutely should take it.",

            "Maybe you guys win it and he likes the environment/team so much he does a \"Wink Wink\" two year deal like Bobby Portis did.",
            "That\u2019s best case. I wouldn\u2019t blame him at all if he didn\u2019t. \nHelped get us out first finals. \nHe\u2019s a combo guard pushing 30 that relies on his athleticism for defense and is a streaky three point shooter. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong that\u2019s exactly what the Nuggets are going to put around Joki\u0107 for the rest of career and it\u2019s absolutely perfect. \nBut history says guys like him typically drop off after 30. \nHe hasn\u2019t been paid like a tier 2 player ever before, if someone gives him 3-4 year deal between 16-20 a year I would 10/10 take it and never look back.",
            "I don't think he proved anything in Brooklyn, quite the opposite, they needed him to play like a guard and space the floor and he did the opposite\nHis playstyle as a guard is weird, he is left open majority of the time, his main offensive move is a floater and rim running, that's not that useful for most teams, he was so low volume on threes and now he is taking a bit  more which makes him slightly more useful",
            "He was one of the most productive players for the Nets vs the Celtics and has helped catapult the Nuggets to title contention. Why are you hating so hard?",

            "He was good, but I don\u2019t think many people expected him to be as good as he is with the Nuggets- he also is a perfect fit with Jokic as an active cutter and short roll passer/rim runner. \nThe fact of the matter is that normal sized guard who isn\u2019t a great volume shooter or ball handler is not a high upside profile. That\u2019s not to say he can\u2019t do those things, but I hadn\u2019t shown that he could with the Nets- they used him a lot like GP2 in the warriors system. Valuable to a contender, but not as much as a 3&D wing, backup rim protector/ball handler, shooter, etc since he has to be used in a very specific way to be successful.\nHe outperformed expectations and is a great player for sure, but its not really hating to say that it wasn\u2019t obvious if he had that in him. Like, no fan of any team was clamoring to get Bruce Brown last year, which is his point.",
            ">and has helped catapult the Nuggets to title contention. \nWe are discussing his free agency. This happened after his free agency.",
            "It's not hate, are you fucking reading the comment? Why are fanboys so fucking defensive and cannot use the brain\nEven the player himself is saying it had no offers, watch the guy play you can understand why he didn't get offers it's 2023 99.99% NBA guards have the complete opposite skillset\nYes he was productive, he was a good role player but the style of play he plays as a guard is not very useful hence no offers, most teams don't want a guard that plays like a big because you need shooting and spacing out of your guards\nNuggets can afford that since you have your center that can shoot and playmake and space the floor",
            "So just because he doesn't conform to your ideal of what a guard should be he shouldn't be paid? He's an effective (useful) player. Shot 40% from 3 in his last season for the Nets by the way.",
            "Why are you just saying so much stupid shit? Where did i say he shouldn't get paid?\nLook at what you are typing, shot 40% from three, yes in fucking 0.5 makes per game while he was wide open majority of the time, that's terrible low volume\nDo you understand why teams didn't offer him? He is a guard that made 0.5 threes, teams want guards to be good shooters majority of the time so it fits their offense better\nNobody is saying he shouldn't get paid, my entire point is it's understandable why most teams didn't want him, he is a niche player that is only useful in certain teams and majority of teams don't have Jokic, Murray, MPJ, KCP, etc all good shooters",
            "Damn hes getting riled up on this lol\nBruce Brown fits that team well thats all it is.\nKind of like GP2 for the Warriors system.",
            "Yes exactly, i'm not riled up at all this dude is saying i'm hating on Bruce Brown of all people, lol Bruce Brown, a good dude and a decent role player\nThe entire point of my first comment which biased fans think it's hate is proven right, you need the right fit and majority of teams are not right fit for a guard that can't shoot",
            "> I don't think he proved anything in Brooklyn, quite the opposite, they needed him to play like a guard and space the floor and he did the opposite\nI think he proved he was a solid contributor to a contender in Brooklyn. He may have not been what they needed, but he proved that he has value in this league in my opinion.",
            "Yes, valuable for certain teams, not for every team, hence no offers because again like i keep repeating, a guard that cannot shoot is not valuable to many teams\nIt's not hate, it's straight up facts, but here you are thinking Bruce Brown of all people is getting \"hate\"",
            "The league doesn't really value defense much if you're not a proven shooter or scorer. Especially from smaller guys. Gary Payton was an elite defender before he got to Golden State and they signed him for nothing. \nThis situation is dumber since Brown was at 40% from 3 and scored efficiently last year.",
            "He\u2019s such a perfect guy to play with Jokic, hopefully they can keep him",
            "He's the perfect complement to Jokic and Murray, none of his main strengths overlap with theirs",

He\u2019s likely gonna get offered some big money this offseason",

Over 19 years that seems irrelevant. \nI no longer think there is anything here unless more details come out.",
            "So this is quick and dirty and has some problems, but\nSince Lewis came into the league, the Celtics have a .577 win percentage.\nIn games he refs, they have a .633 win percentage.\nIf you remove the games he reffed, that's a .574 win percentage (aka it doesn't change much because he's only reffed 79 games in that span).\nThe Celtics would be expected to win about 45 games he reffed; they won 50. Is that significant? I don't know. It also doesn't take into account that maybe he reffed more games for them when they were good than when they weren't. That data's hard to track.\nHowever, if you look at the Lakers... they also won more games than would be expected during his career, and the Lakers have one of the highest FT differentials of any team he's reffed. Which once again could mean nothing, but you know, it's not like the Celtics are some juggernauts when he refs and the Lakers are crap.",

They were yelling AH, AHH at each other for about two hours. Crows left on a mission and returned with more crows in tow. When (i'm pretty sure) the entire town's crow population was assembled for compulsory voting, they took turns arguing in two groups.\nOne group yelled confidently in one tone, and when they'd said what needed saying, the other group yelled in a higher, questioning tone. They repeated this noisy vote-taking about 3 times, with some changing sides (and trees) to join the first group.\nThen two crows who were talking the wrong shit, apparently, fled the trees, but the murder was ready - they swarmed the wrongdoers and pecked them to death in moments. I watched over the fence with my mouth open. I did not attempt to render aid to the corpses, because those birds would have confiscated my eyeballs, at the very least.\nThey're so effing smart. And i still wonder what the transgression was.",

            "Once upon a time, during the height of the Cold War, chess became a clandestine battlefield for superpowers to showcase their strategic prowess. Legend has it that the game originated in the hidden chambers of the Kremlin, where Soviet masterminds developed an intricate system of coded moves to transmit classified information to their operatives around the world.\nAs tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union intensified, both nations realized the potential power of chess as a covert communication tool. The American government, led by President Ronald Reagan, formed a top-secret chess division within the CIA. This division's mission was to recruit brilliant chess players and train them in the art of espionage, disguising their activities as international chess tournaments.\nOne of the most renowned chess spies was William \"The Bishop\" Thompson, an American grandmaster who possessed extraordinary mental acuity and a photographic memory. Thompson was dispatched to the Soviet Union under the guise of a diplomatic chess tournament, where he would compete against the Soviet champion, Ivan Petrov.\nUnder the watchful eye of KGB agents disguised as chess officials, Thompson showcased his impressive skills on the board. It was rumored that each move he made conveyed hidden messages to American operatives stationed worldwide. The Soviets, oblivious to the covert nature of the game, saw Thompson as an exceptionally gifted player.\nAs the match between Thompson and Petrov progressed, the tension between the two superpowers reached its peak. The world was on edge, unaware of the true magnitude of the chess game unfolding before them. It was believed that the outcome of the match could determine the fate of the Cold War.\nHowever, as the match neared its climax, cracks in the facade began to emerge. Rumors started circulating that Thompson's chess moves were not coded messages but simply strategic maneuvers. Chess enthusiasts and experts around the world began questioning the fantastical claims surrounding the game and its connection to espionage.\nFinally, during a critical moment in the match, Thompson made a bold move that was intended to convey a secret message to an American operative in Moscow. Suddenly, a blinding beam of light engulfed the entire chessboard, accompanied by a peculiar humming sound. To the astonishment of everyone present, a spaceship descended from the heavens, carrying beings from a distant galaxy.\nThese extraterrestrial visitors, known as the Zephyrians, claimed to have been observing Earth's chess matches for centuries. They declared that chess was not a mere human invention but a universal language of strategy, revered across the cosmos. The Zephyrians offered their wisdom and unparalleled chess skills to both Thompson and Petrov, seeking to guide them towards a grand cosmic victory.\nUnder the tutelage of the Zephyrians, Thompson and Petrov became vessels of otherworldly genius, executing mind-boggling moves that surpassed human comprehension. Their pieces seemed to glide across the board with supernatural grace, defying the laws of physics. Spectators watched in awe as the match transformed into a celestial spectacle.\nYet, as the game continued, the cracks in the story became apparent. Observant chess aficionados noticed the inconsistencies in the alien presence. Their spaceship seemed oddly reminiscent of a prop from a B-movie science fiction flick, and the Zephyrians' broken English accent betrayed their true origin as amateur actors.\nThe chess community soon realized that they had been duped by an audacious hoax. The revelation sent shockwaves through the world, tarnishing the reputation of the match and adding a bizarre chapter to the annals of chess history.\nNonetheless, the story of chess entwined with aliens during the Cold War serves as a testament to humanity's yearning for the extraordinary. It reminds us that even in the most serious of times, our imaginations can take flight, weaving tales of cosmic encounters and transcendent battles that defy the limits of our own reality.",

His wheels look like the same size/hardness as I had.\nCan any skaters explain how he's not getting thrown off his board and eating shit at the first pebble or minor crack in the ground?",
            "Partly it\u2019s about being light on your feet, and shifting your weight. If all your weight is on your front and you hit a rock with a front wheel yah you\u2019re gonna go flying. But the less weight you\u2019re mashing onto the front the better.\nThat\u2019s part of it. The other part I never figured out lol",

            "It totally happens all the time, they just edit it out lol. He obviously knows this route and has more or less planned this run. And it's not unlikely they've gone through on foot and kicked any little rocks and pebbles they saw out of the way. It's a part of skating that doesn't often end up on videos because it's not interesting but if you watch enough skating videos eventually you'll see them A) eating shit because they hit a tiny pebble, B) kicking at rocks where they plan to skate, or C) literally sweeping the area with a broom, especially the landing area of a big gap. Pebbles are the great leveler, in every way, I've seen really good skaters fuck themselves up real good because of a hilariously small pebble that just stops them in their tracks as they're going 20mph down some bigass hill. There's always some schadenfreude involved, and sympathy, because it happens to everyone eventually.",
            "Yeah, I guess the equivalent for skiing is catching an edge and even though it's way more rare as you gain experience and skill, it's something that can happen to anyone, particularly if you like freestyle skiing.\nThere's a video of either a World cup or Olympic event from the '80s where some ski racer catches an edge, and I believe that causes him to cut the next gate too close which is a large part of why we have breakaway gates now, and he literally broke his pelvis and bled out and died before even the medics got to him.\nHell, even the best, Lindsey Vonn, Bodie Miller, and Michaela Shiffrin have all caught an edge and eaten shit in World Cups and Olympics.\nAlthough I guess the difference is that the reason why somebody catches an edge can very pretty wildly, but the reason why you hit a pebble with your wheel is just because you hit a pebble with your wheel.",

            "There\u2019s definitely references in the video to Persephone, Hades and Charon in Greek mythology but I\u2019m too tired to figure out my thoughts yet",
            "They definitely weren\u2019t filmed in the same location. Not that it really matters, but working in the music video space it\u2019s really obvious. I\u2019ve seen people saying it might have been a rush job, but a music video with visual effects of this scale couldn\u2019t be a rush job unless they spent an absolute insane amount of money and hired out a couple of studios. No one in their right mind would take on a job like this with a quick turnaround unless they were getting a ridiculous amount of money",
            "Seems a bit unhinged to use a private jet that emits tonne after tonne of greenhouse gas emissions, and then to paint herself as being one with earth in a music video, unironically called \u201cKarma\u201d. I love Taylor, but she should definitely be offsetting her emissions and acknowledging the climate crisis",
            "as a basic bitch, i love it. \ud83e\udd2d",

            "I love Ice Spice and Taylor but this version doesn\u2019t really sound good to me. Ice Spice\u2019s parts sounds kinda off and doesn\u2019t mix well with the song.",
            "It sounds off to me as well, it didn\u2019t match. Maybe vigilant shit would work better with a rap remix",
            "I think it's a cute video and I'm really happy Karma got an actual (visually beautiful!!) video and not just tour footage treatment.\nKarma might be my favourite off OG Midnights so I'm really happy it's getting the love \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",
            "I personally interpret the last scene as such : the person sat at the piano represents Joe (they wrote a few songs together and she clearly references him in karma : \"the guy on the screen coming straight home to me\").\nBut what is truly interesting is the cup of coffee with the clock on it at 11:55pm (that time clearly references doomsday). She was almost at the end of her relationship with Joe when writing midnights, so when the clock strikes 12 it clearly shows the end of something.\nAlso coffee being served at midnight reminds me of the line \"midnights become my afternoons\".",
            "Love the video, but so sad Jack\u2019s kept in that annoying erratic beep noise throughout - it even seemed louder during the first few lines from Ice Spice. \nI\u2019ve never had a song trigger my misophonia like Karma does, just from that random sound splattered throughout. It\u2019s usually knuckles cracking or loud chewing, but that woodblock esque sound is so annoying \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72. \nI\u2019ve been a Karma theorist for years, was so hyped for the song. But just that sound ugh \ud83d\ude29.",

            "i\u2019m sorry but i\u2019m not really into this eras mv.. i mean the visuals are pretty but they make no sense at all.. this could be bejeweled mv and i wouldn\u2019t notice the differece.. and what was the mountain taylor about?",
            "Was that supposed to be the Lake District?",
            "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t like it",
            "Me either! I guess it would\u2019ve been better if it was the OG version rather than the remix. Liked the eras showing up though.",
            "So with the clock striking 12 and her fingers positioned at 8 and 2, I\u2019m guessing that the next re-recording after SNTV will be Reputation TV (according to The Man wall theory) and it will be released on 12/28.",
            "I should say, my initial thought was 2 / Feb for Rep (which would fit the 2024 script) and 8 / August for 1989. But I was thinking it couldn\u2019t be August bc that\u2019s too close to SNTV. Except if it\u2019s August 2024, of course. But I just don\u2019t want to wait that long \ud83d\ude02",
            "Does anyone know who the designer is for the last outfit Ice Spice wears? Legit one of the prettiest dresses I've ever seen. If anyone knows how to describe it, so I could try to find a dupe, I'd also be grateful.",

            "I was thinking the exact same, then in the next scene she's on a boat!!",
            "Does anyone else think the clock striking midnight at the end signifies the end of the midnights era?",
            "I think so! While I do think she\u2019ll be announcing 1989 sooner than we think, I\u2019m not so sure it will be announced before speak now tv so I sticking with the double digit theory I think the vault will be announced 6/6, the album 7/7 and I think the video she filmed for it\u2026which I think is either a vault track or dare I say better than revenge ? will come out the same day",
            "My thought! That she\u2019s done dropping stuff and moving on to other things? Also the purple hourglass representing SN era about to begin?",
            "I think the coffee at the end for the boyfriend  was to signify that time is running out, the clock is about to strike midnight. She could fall for someone else. It's the same with the hourglass. The shot of her on the cat dressed as a 1950s housewife gives Alice in Wonderland vibes, but she's actually Cinderella. The clock is ticking and she's waiting for her prince to find her. With karma, you get what's meant for you. It's cause and effect, but in order for the boyfriend to reap what he sows, he needs to \"say something, do something.\"",
            "Very sure I saw a guy sitting down after she swirled the coffee cup around 3:00 in the mv, had dark hair and looked like Matty a bit. She also sings \u201cKarma is my boyfriend\u201d at that time.",
            "I don\u2019t think so tbh I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s Jack",

            "Top right, the 2 bars",
            "Ty!!!",
            "The end scene when she is holding the midnight cup, you can see a blue nail on the left and a black nail on the right. Maybe referencing people though the Karma album was supposed to be after 1989 and Reputation ended up replacing it?",
            "Or that her next recordings will be 1989 and Rep?",
            "I feel like Taylor is more controversial than Kanye at this point.\nLook, I love my girl. But it\u2019s so hard to be a Taylor fan right now - we\u2019re being persecuted left and right. I feel like she\u2019s really taken on that role of being a true anti-hero. \nI feel like the entire world is against Taylor right now. They hate her success, and I understand they hate her boyfriend too. \nI\u2019m just so scared to say I\u2019m a swiftie in public because of the perception that brings. \nI didn\u2019t sign up to be edgy when I became a swiftie lol. I do appreciate that it makes her more complex though.\nShe\u2019s SO underrated",
            "I promise if you log off and not read twitter threads for breakfast you'll realise most people irl just simply do not care... people are consuming her music at the same rate as before any of this controversy, she's performing for sold out stadiums, is winning awards left and right and recieving praise from icons in the industry like stevie nicks the other day. It'll be okay lol.",
            "I doubt \u201cunderrated\u201c is the right word for probably the biggest artist of our time that is about to become a billionaire\u2026",
            "\n\nComparing Taylor\u2019s levels of controversies to Kanye\u2019s is so tone deaf. Taylor has not said anything hateful towards any group. Do not compare them at all.\n\n\nShe literally is selling out stadiums 3 nights a week and breaking charting records all the time. The whole world is not against Taylor. \n\n\nShe is most certainly not underrated. She\u2019s the biggest pop star currently on the planet. Her lyrics can, at times, be underrated, but she most certainly isn\u2019t underrated.\n\n\nEdit: 4. Most things that Taylor is being criticised for currently is warranted. She\u2019s dating a bigot, she\u2019s pushing the capitalism thing a little too hard, and her remix with Ice Spice was lazily put together. \nIt\u2019s OK to criticise her when she needs it.",

            "So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but this seems to imply that either SN will have a MV or there will be a another song on this album with a MV since there was no Joey King or Taylor Lautner in this.",
            "I also think it\u2019s SN!",
            "The video made me appreciate Ice Spice's contribution to the song so much more! The remix is really growing on me now.",
            "I think indeed that considering the video, the remix and Ice Spice are completely unnecessary. She seems like a passer-bye inside the video\u2026",

            "Same. I really like Ice Spice and her vibe/style is great in general, but she looked like a hostage in this video. Her persistent exhausted glare while deadpanning the most low-effort lyrics was kinda uncomfortable. Would love to know if there's any tea on how this collab between two very talented people ended up like... this. Ice is such a vibe but she looks sedated here.",
            "Thank you! Someone said it",
            "yeah she looks kinda uncomfortable. Also this isn\u2019t directed towards her, but i absolutely hate her parts. They don\u2019t fit in at all and seem like a terrible mashup. I really want to see the og karma mv now.",
            "Also the transitions are awesome specially the ones in the beginning",
            "The mv is beautiful, a bit weirdo but fun to watch. But Ice Spice parts are a big no and skip. Her facial expression is the same for the whole song just like her rapping parts.One flow for such a quirky song. I wanted an mv for the original version because the mv is great and entertaining but Ice Spice's parts are just a huge No.",

            "Thank you for saying that!! It needed to be said",
            "isn\u2019t it bad tho that it took her this long to feature a black artist.  Also i don\u2019t think her featuring a black artist means we cannot critique a song. It\u2019s good that you guys like this version and it\u2019s a good move on her part. Ice spice seems like a cool person but the song just doesn\u2019t flow well for me\ntldr: we can still hate/critique the art while not hating the people involved.",

You have basically summarised the problem with social media. irl people are never gonna personally attack someone if they don\u2019t like their art, but it\u2019s too easy to do that and get away with it online. Try to stay away from online swiftie spaces for a couple days, it\u2019s probably gonna die down. soon. I\u2019m only using this subreddit to mainly keep up with the tour",

I know nothing of her other than in the tswizzle controversy, and I think it's awful what Matt said about her, so I'm glad that she's at least getting to be in a freaking Taylor Swift mv. That's radical and far out. Love it. Good for both of them, wishing Ice Spice success in her career. She's a very pretty woman too, I had no idea what she even looked like.",

He\u2019s responsible for caring the souls through the rivers that separate the worlds of the living and the dead.\nTaylor presents herself as Charon. She\u2019s dyed so many times that she\u2019s now familiarised with the path and guides the other souls. Ice Spice\u2019s new in the industry and still needs guidance.\nAlso important to notice that the Hindus believe you can avoid being reborn by getting rid of your karma. This can be achieved by being selfless and having empathy \u2014 and it usually takes many lives.\nTaylor\u2019s learned from her many deaths and got rid of her karma becoming now a part of the underworld herself.",

Also I hate the new version. I just don\u2019t feel like ice spice actually added anything to the song. Like they just threw that verse in there. It doesn\u2019t make the song better. The part where she just say \u201cfacts\u201d. Super cringy for me. Nothing against Ice Spice but her tone and what she\u2019s bringing just doesn\u2019t go with the song. The visuals are doing anything for me either.",

I don\u2019t know her at all so maybe it\u2019s her vibe to be like so innocent or something but it doesn\u2019t match the song. And I agree with someone else that taylor has a bit of a serious killer look instead of playful but maybe that\u2019s how she intended the song. All in all I really like the video though",
            "I think part of Ice Spice's woodenness is due to her being so fresh on the scene. I watched several of her other videos after this one and in some her energy is higher(like the one with Nicki), but in a good number, she seems like she is unsure of her footing and I think that will only improve with time.",

Well at least that's the role she plays all the time and when there's a song where she can be a badass boss B*tch she just sitting and barely moves any muscle in her face or her tones are just dry and feels like she sings 1 melody over and over again.",
            "It\u2019s weird because Ice Spice and Nicki have a MV together and she is so much more emotive in it and you can tell she\u2019s vibing - so I guess I was expecting a bit more than such a blank expression? No hate though I just thought it was a bit plain.",

            "Thank you! Everyone is being extremely rude about her. Her music has only blown up in the last year and she has very few music videos.",
            "Love the beginning of the MV especially the \"storybook\" part when she sweeps the floor. Gets a bit more generic as it goes on but still good overall. Wish it was for the original version tho, Ice Spice looks and sounds bored and I'm not a fan of her verse",

You cannot possibly believe this is a \u201cPR move\u201d from Taylor that she put together in the last two weeks to protect matty (who btw actually didn\u2019t say anything about ice spice, if you listened to the clip you\u2019d see it was the podcast host and not him). She said herself this was done at the beginning of the year. If you don\u2019t want to believe that, then why are you here? Music videos like this take meticulous planning and preparation, and this clearly had a large budget. Taylor is a very busy person and a workaholic. If, as many of you say, ice spice was filmed on a different green screen, maybe that\u2019s because they couldn\u2019t be in the room at the same time! What a wild concept! But no, let\u2019s hate on Taylor and say she did this as damage control, because that\u2019s what fans do now :)",

By giving her an MS steroid, you retain her identity while giving her much needed survivability.\nGiving mobility should balance hero identity and mechanic. They both work thematically as a ninja yes, but it removes what makes Hanabi unique compared to other ninja-themed characters.",
            "Yeah, well, as much as you're correct, I'm not really talking about that, haha. But yes, she can use the movement speed. Maybe also some camouflage as well. A stealthy, nimble killer fits the narrative of a ninja, yes?",

            "\nGlowing blue outline. Starts from feet and progresses upward\nFull body glow, removing all color and just leaving a silhouette. Starts from the right foot and progresses upward, but actually goes *down* the left foot and through the skirt a bit later.\nOverlaying the new outfit silhouette. This happens roughly simultaneously with the application of the full body glow, but not exactly at the same time, since the new outfit's skirt doesn't appear until after the full body glow has reached her torso and the glow starts traveling down her left leg. That being said, it appear like the *front* edge of the skirt appear first, then progressing to the back.\nFull-body glow intensifies. This is accomplished through many visual indicators - the blue outline \"fringe\" around the model grows brighter and thicker, there's a brightening effect on the foreground and background around her, and you can also see a lens flare/star shape at around waist height.\nPop into the new outfit. Rather than a laterally-progressing animation like the two glow steps going into the transformation, this applies to the whole body at once. The glowing white silhouette effect eases off and the colors and details of the new outfit can now be seen.\nMagic fairy dust. The \"pop\" or \"explosion\" of the transformation gives off a large number of small blue Hololive triangles. These travel in paths similar to soap bubbles or petals, pulse brighter and softer, and get progressively smaller until fading out. They don't rotate at all once they're created, though.\n\nI'm really intrigued by all the steps that went into this animation. It's not a trivial thing. Even each of these steps may have needed custom shaders and pathing to accomplish. The overall effect looks very nice. Professional, natural, and obviously reminiscent of classic magical girl transformations. I especially enjoy the first step - the glowing blue outline - since that's something I haven't seen employed in any similar morphing/transformation sequence in any type of media, animated or CGI. Not saying it's never been done before, but it's the first time I've seen it.\nEdit: Oh, I didn't notice this before, but the shoes change shape completely separately from the rest of the silhouette. Check it out. This makes me think that maybe the full-body glow step involves overlaying the new outfit on top of the old outfit with the full-body glow shader attached to it, and then for a moment both models are superimposed, and then the old outfit model is taken away while the full-body glow shader is still on.",

            "Meron HAHAHA. Umamin ako recently and it was okay for her daw, tsaka she's my friend naman, ayon nga lang we barely talk lol pero I suppose that's fine! I will still help her kailangan niya man o hindi and oh, cute raw ako \u263a\ufe0f Thanks crushie!",
            "u/BabyFlo09 kinikilig ka sa crush mo?",

            "meroooon. yung bumble match ko huhu first time kong ma-amuse nang ganito sa someone i met online. grabe ka-passionate sa profession, it\u2019s so attractive. super bait and thoughtful pa. ipagluluto nya raw ako. ngyon lng ulit ako nagkacrush since HS, ganitong setup pa.",
            "Ayoko na magkaroon ng crush kase nagiging close ako sa kanya tapos in the end mumultuhin lang din ako.\nMeron akong isa pinaghirapan ko for a year, brought her to dates and good terms rin ako sa fam niya, only to know that she's talking to someone sa Litmatch, kaya pala minumulto na ako. After realizing that fact, I've been trying hard to not talk to her ever since.",

            "Meron. First time ko magkacrush ng ganito. Usually happy crush lang.\nI met him sa bumble. Like 2 days palang kami magkamatch nagkita na kami. Sa meet up namin grabe yung feeling na parang \u201cthe universe is aligned\u201d. We were both wearing same color. I guess we like the same things. There were no dull moments. Wholesome vibes din. Ang daming ganap nung araw na yon. Ayaw namin matapos yung gabi, like grabe. Naging theme song ko yung Enchanted ni Taylor Swift.  Then ayon. Naging cold\u2026 he became like a zombie. Mawawala, lilitaw. Mag reply after hours or days. \nSo ayon akala ko kami both are into each other. Ako lang pala. Saddd lang. buttttt thankful padin ako naexperience ko yung super over infatuated. First time ko yon! \nKinikilig padin ako while writing this. HAHAHAHA \ud83e\udd17",

We\u2019ve been working together for like half a year but it just seems so hard to approach her with me being a recluse and her being kinda in the same vein. Her colleagues tell me she talks about me often but I just can\u2019t take office talk seriously these days. MAN",
            "Meron pero naguusap lang kami pag magpapasched ako ng appointment sakanya. Basta, hanggan duon lang. Haha",
            "Di ko alam if considered padin siya na crush kasi nagkaroon kami ng something, more like a situationship for 2 or 3 months i knew i liked her she said na she liked me too, kaso sabi niya naguguluhan daw siya sa situationship namin if gusto niya padin ipagpatuloy after that it ended, 2 months na nakakalipas she's still on my mind i still like her so baka crush ko pa din?

            "Meron kaso shuta hindi ko alam ano gagawin ko dito. Laging nag re-reach out pero napaka dry texter. Maybe it's because he's Japanese but dude how can I communicate if the conversations always run out of life. Haha.",
            "Yung crush ko, solid for five years na. HAHAHA. Ayon, from time to time naalala ko pa rin nung hinanap niya ko para mag dinner nung nasa isang conference kami kasi nag freelance writer ako para sa kanya (siya yung direktor nung national org at siya rin proprietor nung event). Ni-text niya ko, nasaan na raw ako, kain na raw kami. Tapos after nung dinner ng event, nagpunta kami sa hotel bar (kasi sa hotel ginanap yung event), kinausap niya ko ano raw intensyon ko. Ni-shoo away niya mga nang-iinterrupt (kasi busy person siya, very in demand). \nHay. Mga bituin na maningning na mahirap abutin.",

            "Meron, WFH kami tapos nung nagkaroon ng event sa office, dun ko lang siya na-meet in person, dun ko rin naumpisahang maging crush siya. Office crush?! Ginusto ko na lang pumasok sa office, para ganado naman ako magwork. HAHA. Kaso ayun, back to WFH ulit. \ud83d\ude06",

I\u2019m making sure to always realize how beautiful she is, and that I\u2019d hold her hand anywhere and be so proud to be with her. \nI like her so much and I\u2019ve already done a lot to always be there for her\u2014and it doesn\u2019t feel like a chore at all.\nI just love being with her.

            "Yes. Bihira ako magka-crush since after college. Last time was in 2021. We were friends then I just realized I had a crush on him na pala! Nasanay ako sa dating or flings agad. Wala yung crush stage. Ang saya din pala and masakit sa tyan \ud83d\ude02 but all good since we\u2019re together now and crush ko parin siya! \ud83e\udd2d",

            "I really never thought that doc painted Scottie in all that bad a light. I didn\u2019t feel any type of way about him afterwards, at least.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s no Michael Jordan without Scottie Pippen\u201d\u2026still don\u2019t understand how dude felt he was slighted",
            "I think it was Michael that said Scottie was being selfish for delaying surgery. And then there\u2019s the silent tantrum when Kukoc was given the last shot. Those are my guesses to why Pip is so upset about the docuseries and Michael",
            "Scottie should only be upset with himself for that shit.",
            "Context matters, he was criminally underpaid and wanted a new contract during this time. He wasn\u2019t about to use his entire summer to rehab when the owner was refusing to redo a deal or really show they valued him. \nShortly after when MJ came back I believe it was the 30 million a year deal while Scottie was getting something like 2-3. \nMJ told him Jerry won\u2019t redo his deal while netting 30M himself. I don\u2019t think he batted for Scottie. Meanwhile Lebron backed TT for his contract dispute lol",
            "I think there's more context to be added there though.  Scottie was told by several people that the salary cap was going to jump and he'd regret signing such a long contract.  But at the time he signed it, it was good money.  He was one of the top 8 highest paid players in 1993.  Jordan was on a similar contract that was paying him about 3.5 million in 96.  Jordan wasn't in the top 30 players in salary during their 72 win season.  It wasn't until 97 and 98 where Jordan's salary exploded.  He still earned less than Scottie did in his career.",
            "Didnt Krause or Reinsdorf straight up tell him it wasnt gonna be a good move?",
            "Hell yea Reinsdorf said that, he\u2019s the cheapest mother fucker on the planet. Couldn\u2019t be paying Scottie and give MJ 30 mil. Fuck Jerry",
            "It wouldn't have mattered if MJ went to bat for him or not, Reinsdorf would never have renegotiated an existing contract so if that's why he's salty he needs to get over himself. He's the one who locked himself into a contract that was way too long, something Reinsdorf even warned him about at the time.",
            "MJ wasn't paid shit either until his final years.  He was criminally underpaid.\n&#x200B;\nHe's also said himself that if he signs something he'll honor it till the end.  \n&#x200B;\nHe's not being a hypocrite about it at least.",
            "That's one thing you can say about MJ. He's not a hypocrite. He's a shit owner though. He needs to hire a Pat Riley to handle the Front Office stuff for him.",
            "Shit I hate the guy and I'll take a Pat Riley immediately",
            "In that era too.\nJordan was insane.",
            "People warned him against the deal. He did it anyway. \nAnd I dgaf about LeGM getting dudes like TT paid. If a front office is dumb enough to overpay for TT or Jr Smith or whoever then it is what it is.",
            "Pippin is an idiot who signed a bad deal then acted like a baby when the team wanted to honor it. Fuck that guy.",
            "Mj was earning peanuts until then tho.",
            "Agreed. That's why it's so puzzling but also so funny.",
            "I rewatched The Last Dance recently too.\nA few corners of social media have been going on since it came out about how much of a propaganda piece it is for Jordan, and how it\"leaves out all his bad stuff to only brush him in a positive light\"...but yet when I revisited...the doc includes:\n--The Steve Kerr punch situation and Jordan admitting he was wrong about it\n\nJordan being an asshole to his teammates, with his actual teammates featured in the doc stating that he was difficult to deal with and not friendly\n\n-The \"republicans buy sneakers too\" saga...even outright bringing up how Jordan lost some of the black community at the time because he did not publicly support Harvey.\n-Jordan losing to the Pistons repeatedly before finally getting over the hump\n-Jordan struggling in baseball and getting clowned for it\n\nSpotlight of Jordan's gambling problems , who he was tied to..and they literally even go as far as to inform within the doc that there are people that think Jordan's gambling problems had something to do with his father's death. \n\nWhat else were they supposed to throw in? Lmao",
            "Apparently it was supposed to only paint him in a negative light and no one else. Lol",
            "It showed his discontent with the front office was justified, but despite that he still showed up for the team. Also they made it clear he was a crucial part of the team\u2019s success.  \nIt\u2019s pretty clear that the dynasty never starts it\u2019s run without Scottie. It barely touches on the Jordanless years, which Scottie performed well during but ultimately had some of his lowest points as well.",
            "I kinda get it from Pippen's POV because the worst part of his career was highlighted there but you can't really tell the Bulls story without mentioning that.",
            "But it didn\u2019t talk about his season with the Rockets at all.",
            "Trailblazers legend Scottie Pippen",
            "I want to see what was left on the editing floor, because I think he went into it with good intentions and didn\u2019t like the edit.  Which honestly, I get.  It wasn\u2019t a story about the bulls, it was a story about Jordan - masquerading as a story about the Bulls.  But I think it was pitched as a story about the bulls.\nHonestly Rodman got the worst edit though.  I think they only mentioned once what a defensive powerhouse he was, and then spent most of it on his fuck ups.",
            "Tbf who is watching a doc with the overarching story about the Bulls and not Jordan tho",
            "I mean I think that the Bulls run was enough in and of itself to get doc without so much of the Jordan hype.  I know eventually they will make a Patriots one which the edit will depend on who produces it - team/football fan or Brady or Bill themselves \ud83d\ude02 and I will watch the shit out of it regardless - because it was historic.",
            "It didn\u2019t masquerade as being about the bulls lol. It was upfront about being about the bulls. Cmon now",
            "Agree. It happened but doesn\u2019t change that Scottie was an all-timer and a one man defensive wrecking crew. Have to wonder if his legacy is different with a title in Portland.",
            "Also, Pippen has been disrespected by some people in the media in general. Obviously as someone who considers Jordan to be the GOAT, I find his comments today to be incredibly preposterous, but I can kind of understand Scottie's frustration. Additionally, he's gone through a lot over the past few years in his personal life where he got divorced and then his oldest son tragically passed away.",
            ".......and his ex wife is dating none other than Michael Jordan's son.\nOuch",
            "The game he refused to play? I also didn\u2019t think he came off badly in general.",
            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that he came off in a bad light as it is that the majority of the documentary was all about Jordan as opposed to the team.",

            "Yeah! He only managed 37.1ppg on .562 TS% !! .....o_o",
            "When you factor in the Bulls would regularly score around 100 or less as a team, 37ppg is unreal. It wasn\u2019t unprecedented for MJ to have half his team\u2019s points in a game\u2026\nAND play top tier defense on the other end",
            "The dude averaged 32-33 points out of the bulls\u2019 88 in both the 97 and 98 finals. He also had 6 assists in 97\nThe bulls offense was stagnant without him",
            "In that era too.\nJordan was insane.",
            "The late 80s were not actually that low scoring compared to recent years. For example, in 86-87, the year MJ averaged 37 ppg, teams averaged 110 points in a game, which is the same as last year. It wasn't until the mid to late 90s and early 2000s that scores really started to go down, only to balloon up again in the  late 2010s.",

            "Scrub",
            "Pippen's role wasn't to score, it was to make plays, rebound, and guard the best player on the other team. He'd do that and also give you 20 points a game.",
            "Are we going to pretend that wasn't Jordan's job before Scottie arrived and did the same thing while averaging 33?  \nThey both made eachothers life easier.  They were a disgusting duo on both sides of the ball.",

He\u2019s not like these guys who take classes on to be personable and speak to the press. The dude signed a billion dollar deal with Nike while smoking cigars, calling players midgets, and gambling every chance he could. \nMost players wish they could be themselves and make 1/10th the amount MJ did",

            "Did you miss the part where they were talking about his gambling and the possible connection to his father's murder before his first retirement? That this narrative continued to exist even after he returned?",
            "Yeah everybody knows MJ is a psycho and he doesn't hide it either. Scottie sounds like a salt mine these days.",

I did extensive research into the topic when I was fitting my adopted indoor/outdoor stray with a bell to help warn the local fauna of his presence, and all signs pointed to he won't care unless your cat happens to be particularly skittish.  \nBy far the larger danger to the animal seems to be the collar itself being a choking/strangle hazard due to it being ill-fitting, a malfunctioning breakaway mechanism, a negligent owner not using a breakaway collar at all, or any combination thereof.",
            "I had a bell on my cat\u2019s collar when I first got her. But I could tell it was annoying her. So I took it off. You don\u2019t need studies and articles to just be aware of what your pet does or doesn\u2019t like.",
            "the cats took their own collars off and fucking hid them from us",
            "I won't lie I did not find any article supporting this, but imo is just common sense. I wanted to use a bell collar on my cats and my veterinarian said I shouldn't, then I asked my friend vet (who lives far away so she is not my cats' vet) and she said the same. So yeah, there's articles saying they don't care but at the same time in the same article it says \"they don't care unless something something\", so I don't want to risk my cats being stressed just cuz I think it's cute, cuz if they don't like it they won't be able to warn me of that",
            "You should ask your vet why they think they shouldn't. Personally, I'd be concerned if I found out my vet was making health-care recommendations off of rumor and old-wives tales.  I prefer when my medical professionals use science.\nFWIW, my vet said that my cat would probably hate the collar itself rather than the bell, and he was right. My cat has lost four different breakaway collars somewhere in the farmland around my house. Lord knows if I'll ever find them.",
            "I understand your point, but we're talking about animals lives here, lives that just need one mistake to bad things to happen, so if an article is telling me it's ok but there's \"buts\" involved, I don't see a reason to risk it, and I think personally other people shouldn't too even if it's not my cats we're talking about.\nIf there's a chance my cat will be stressed and maybe be killed by larger fauna just because of a cute bell, I don't think that's an option.",
            "Let's reset for a minute:\nI'm not in any way saying that someone should always use a bell as a blanket statement regardless of living situation and your own animal's temperament. If your cat is an indoor only cat and there's nobody else in the house who needs to be \"warned\" the cat is approaching, then by all means, stick with no bell! \nHell, if it's an indoor cat and you trust the cat not to bolt when the front door opens or you live somewhere with double doors or something, shoot maybe you don't need a collar at all! \nRegardless of if you live in either of the above, you can choose to use a bell if you want to with the knowledge that, unless your animal shows signs of distress, you can rest easy that a bell most likely won't be any more harmful or risky than the collar itself already is. \nAll that said, for outdoor cats, where a bell is advisable due to the otherwise harmful effects that the cat will have on the bird and small rodent population, the benefits to both the cat and the wildlife far outweigh the already minimal risks.  Even if I didn't care about the birds and rabbits I'd put a bell on my cat because, as you said, \"it only takes one bad thing\", and I don't want my cat getting a parasite from some sick animal he catches and eats. The bell is actually helping preserve his health and welfare.",
            "This is almost the opinion I have about it. If it's an indoor cat, then there are zero needs for a bell.\nFor an outdoor cat, there is the benefits of not letting them hunt small animals that can carry diseases but there's the risk of being targeted by larger ones, even if there's little to no chance of it, I wouldn't want to risk it. Also we already vaccinate our cats so they won't be easily sick by being outside (or sickened, I don't know how to write this properly)",
            "Personally, I think if there's a real risk of predators, the cat should stay inside. But that's a risk each owner will have to decide to take on their own. \nAround here, I'm lucky we've only got the sporadic fox, but he gets his fill of rabbit usually.",
            "I also vehemently prefer science-based decisions, which is why I find it so incredible that someone clearly spent time researching outdoor cat bells and collars only to then make the decision to allow their cat outdoors unsupervised, against the recommendation of basically every credible scientific source I've ever seen online. Absolutely baffling.\nThanks for the info on bells though, that's good to know.",
            "I looked it up and you are right, there is a German magazine saying that it's similar to tinnitus to cats because they hear it three to four times louder than humans and they also hear higher frequencies (20,000 kHz with humans vs. up to 100,000 with kittens)\nThe issue i birds and other prey which they can kill more easily without a bell",
            "I'd love to see this magazine if possible cuz to be honest I never saw anything about it besides my vet talking about it",

You could make a point that might not matter with Fujimoto, but I also think Denji stopped seeing Power as a woman when he felt her up. Right now Denji is really single-minded in his goal to finally have sex, thinking it will fix everything, even though no one that actually had sex thinks that way. Denji is a virgin. His first time will probably be ruined (or less likely: Fujimoto will give him a tiny piece of happiness to make terrible shit hit harder.).",

            "Yessss exactly. It is definitely not a song that paints Joe as the bad guy. The relationship ran its course.",
            "Exactly, idk how people are taking it any other way. It seems pretty mature, just admitting something is wrong but she can\u2019t explain exactly what. She\u2019s definitely frustrated by the lack of proposal but that really seems like a footnote to the rest of the issues she\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s so relatable for anyone who has ever been in a long term relationship that just fizzled, without any real drama or bad guys.",
            "Honestly, I think it highlights her immaturity and poor communication skills (in a relationship). \nWhile I understand that the song is from Taylor\u2019s POV, she keeps focusing on how the referenced partner is losing her, and not how she\u2019s losing her partner. Like it\u2019s his problem that she feels like their  relationship is slowing dying and he\u2019s not doing anything to save it, much less aware of Taylor\u2019s perception of their relationship status. \nTo Taylor, it makes no sense why her partner has no clue about Taylor\u2019s thoughts about their relationship. Couldn\u2019t he tell from the signals she sent, from the angry morning glares and her bitten nails? She\u2019s sent him so many signals - apart from actually talking to him about the issues. \ud83d\ude44\nOverall, while the lyrics are well written, it sounds like a teenager lyricist in terms of emotional maturity and with notes of victim mentality (e.g. I\u2019ve done and sacrificed everything for you and you can\u2019t do me the favor of interpreting my non-verbal signals to read my thoughts?). \nPlus, the 1st 2 lines scream typical teenager response to a parent who doesn\u2019t understand their teen issue.",
            "Yeah she does seems to have a very teenage mindset of 'if you really loved me you would know what the problem is!' and it's so immature. Use your words people! \nI've never been in this situation with a breakup, but I have with platonic friendships. I used to get mad when they didn't automatically know what I was and wasn't comfortable with because they should know if we're best friends right? I had to let that go and become more comfortable with saying what I did and didn't want to do. Someone not being a mind reader doesn't mean they don't love you.",
            "It's probably a feminist response, as in \"Joe won't let Taylor shine\" or \"Joe is so intimidated of Taylor\". \nThe lyrics even say \"How can you say that you love someone you can\u2019t tell is dying?\" which sounds like Joe barely paid attention to what she had to say.\nWhat I don't get is was there ever a time when Taylor wasn't an A-lister? People talk about 2016 and maybe I wasn't paying attention at the time, but it doesn't seem like Taylor's star ever really waned. I don't see the signs that Joe wanted her to step back from her career.",
            "maybe i was just 17 and dramatic but i feel like the backlash was pretty bad against her? i remember thinking there was no way she was gonna be able to come back from it. \ud83d\udc0d but i always thought her stepping back was a million times smarter than\u2026whatever the fuck this has been lol",
            "Are you a huge fan? I feel like for Taylor and her fans, if you\u2019re looking for hate, you were going to find it (and it was easy to do in 2016). That was the first time Taylor really felt that in her career, so I\u2019m sure it did feel like a lot. \nI\u2019m not a fan, but I love pop culture. I feel like when that Kanye video was first released, Taylor\u2019s name was everywhere. But by the time she took a step back, no one really cared anymore. She didn\u2019t lose fans, the media stopped talking about it, the radio was still playing her. People were excited to see what she did with new music. There was never a point where she wouldn\u2019t have come back from it. And it\u2019s so bizarre how extreme her fans made it seem.",
            "lmao i was/kinda of am a huge fan. i fell into the persecution propaganda",
            "It seemed to me like she was just in the public eye even more. She stepped back (which was definitely smart!), but everyone was talking about her and kanye anyway and then the next year she released Reputation and then went on a tour that became the highest-grossing tour in the US. Like, if Joe really hates celebrity life what a weird time to step in.",
            "no i totally agree tho. someone doesn\u2019t just oopsie their way into a long term relationship w taylor swift lol",
            "I don\u2019t feel like he wanted her to step back from her career but I definitely think he had her step back from pap walks that she was doing alotttt during 1989 era, but tbh she probably would have done that regardless due to overexposure and the whole Kanye mess 2.0.\nA lot of what the crazy swifties (which as a swiftie, I would very much like to be excluded from their narrative) seem to think is Joe hid her light under a bushel or some shit but honestly that\u2019s what her career needed anyways and it didn\u2019t hurt her or her status at all? \nLike I\u2019m more concerned for her now with Problematty, who seems like the worst possible rebound, who is happy to indulge her worst, non-Tree-approved impulses.",
            "There was a fantastic episode of the Sentimental Garbage podcast recently where the host and guest went through Midnights and talked about how it was the breakup album. I hadn\u2019t listened to Midnights, but I love that podcast, so I listened to all the tracks as they discussed them. \nIt was really interesting - they even talked about the suburb of London Joe is from and how that may have impacted his view of fame. \nAs I was listening, I was thinking - yes, this is about all the examination and sadness at the end of a good relationship with a good person, when it just isn\u2019t t going to work out. That has a particular type of sadness to it, which is different than when it is a crappy relationship. \nIt sounds like the new song is along the same lines. I think Taylor is messy, complicated and dramatic and made herself smaller (in some ways) for the relationship and then it fell apart.",
            "Love that podcast! They had lots of really interesting points. I wish they'd analysed the 3am tracks too and that it had come out after this track bc this is the clearest track about her and Joe's break up I'd love to see what they'd say",

There\u2019s that line in Bejeweled about familiarity, and that line along with the top 5, says a lot because it seems like they stopped being on the same wavelength.\nLike Taylor was ready (and has been ready since they first got together) to marry him, and start the next chapter of her life settling, but Joe wasn\u2019t.\nAnd it\u2019s fair because, he was only 25 when he met her just fresh off his very first role out of drama school he worked for and, her life was very much different (cancel culture) and Lover wasn\u2019t a massive hit, her career was calming.\nDoesn\u2019t make him bad or an enemy like people want him to be as you\u2019ve already basically mentioned. \nI think it\u2019s all sad. But also it\u2019s fair game because the fan reaction is just proving why he probably got cold feet and didn\u2019t want to marry. Taylor also parading the bigot around, saying \u201cI love you\u201d immediately, is a slap in the face to their 6 years together. Especially since he was around while Joe was off working.

            "Midnights was also a small album rollout. Did she even give a single interview anywhere? I don't remember her even doing talk shows at all. No promo appearance on Good Morning America (for example).\nMidnights did great numbers but it's not like she went on a press tour like she did with 1989, for example. She basically announced the album, released it, released music videos and went on tour.",
            "Finally someone who has reasoning capabilities \nJoe Alwyn is an upper class Brit (him being front row at a televised funeral should have clued people in). The likelihood that he didn\u2019t want to marry her and have a family with her is high, because she wouldn\u2019t fit into that class (privacy a large issue). He would be fine dating her while he matured, but he wouldn\u2019t marry her.\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s heartbroken and she figured out he was never going to want her so she started acting out (Healy gave her the attention and I think it\u2019s more likely she cheated on Joe for a reaction and his reaction was bye). \nI think Taylor gives men a ton of attention in the early stages which is flattering and then expects them to be obsessed with her and most of them aren\u2019t. I think that\u2019s why she lives for her relationships with her fans even though is clear she needs more boundaries to be healthy. \nI think Joe found her flattering in the first part of the relationship, COVID happened, and then he probably started giving her nothing hoping she would dump him (she cheated instead)\nJoe ain\u2019t going to miss her and she hates that \nShe vibes probably as having a lot of traits of borderline/histrionic and that\u2019s pretty difficult to have a long term relationship with",

The pandemic didn't happen until 2020. \nOver those 4 years, Taylor faced scandals, had two top selling albums, and went on tour in sexy outfits. During the pandemic he only had to spend more time with her.\nI don't think he went in with the wrong intentions, and I especially don't think he stayed in with the wrong intentions. But I do think you're right that Taylor likes the dramatics of a young relationship that aren't tenable in a long term stable one and that she probably cheated.",

It just ran its course. We weren\u2019t as compatible as we thought. \nAnd for me, the \u201cfinal blow\u201d was him talking about picking out Christmas presents for my family, saying he would pitch in. I felt nauseous and knew I couldn\u2019t go through Christmas with him. \nAll this to say: it\u2019s a fabulous breakup song that really speaks to me and if anyone got that Joe did something malicious out of this song they need to work on their comprehension skills.",

            "It\u2019s not just you. My sympathy for Taylor has been thrown out the window the second she got with the janitor mop of all people. Her releasing this now makes me doubt her, \u201chappiest she\u2019s ever been\u201d claims \u2014 which is reminiscent of what happened during Reputation.\nI think Taylor is bitter because Joe axed their relationship and decided to walk away, and if the claims (that they\u2019re saying is true) didn\u2019t want to fix it anymore (that\u2019s if he broke up with her), or he forced her hand \u2014 and let her breakup with him. Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s gotten over them not getting married and this is another reminder. Her pettiness also seems like she\u2019s still bothered by Joe no longer being around and wanted him to either wake up, and come running back, or to her him.\nWhen she ended things with Calvin, it was the exact same thing, \u201che didn\u2019t fight enough for her\u201d which is funny. Because now it\u2019s a rehash and now Matty is taking up space in Joe\u2019s shoes and is being portrayed as her \u201cangel boyfriend\u201d there for her.\nI wonder how she\u2019s gonna react if Joe ever steps out with someone, in Hit\u2019s Different she sung about puking on the street over the thought with him with someone else, now if he marries someone before her, or dated someone I think she\u2019s gonna be even more petty\u2026.",

She has such a finely curated life and her PR is so intentional that it seems like really really bizarre and fascinating to me that she\u2019d do so much of what she\u2019s doing in an attempt to appear fine about the breakup.",

Well lol. He's another highly emotional artist so her being super crazy/emotional aligns nicely with him too and he probably likes what she's like...for now. I can imagine it burning super bright and then going out in flames. She probably needs a mix of both guys to last.",

She's an emotional artist who needs to be loved LOUDLY and accepted for being super ott and extra and as a normal person, that's not him. \nI also disagree that she wants only new excitement in relationships. I think she wants constant ott care and validation at every stage though. She's ready to do that imo as a hopeless romantic but it's obviously tough to find someone who can keep up. It sounds exhausting to anyone who is not a highly charged person. And she was probably exhausted from trying to be more low key and normal to please him too.

She\u2019s basically telling him by song, \u201chow\u201d to stop it before it\u2019s too late; but it already is.\nThe song is another take of Exile as well \u2014 similar themes, he\u2019s oblivious to the signs, cause he can\u2019t read her mind and using signs as \u201ccommunication\u201d \u2014 every relationship goes through this (drifting apart) platonic, and non-platonic and unfortunately it hits the end where you just can\u2019t save it anymore, cause you\u2019re at the cross road with too much unresolved baggage.\nAlso the argument of, \u201che doesn\u2019t want to marry her\u201d is so manipulative. I don\u2019t think he \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d I just don\u2019t think he was ready, as by government statistics last time I\u2019ve checked, British men tendency to settle is age 35 & up, he lacks the life experience as Taylor.\nIt\u2019s also so silly to say because by their logic, if we meet a man we\u2019ve just met and I want to marry them, can I now say I\u2019m entitled to marriage and the man \u201cmust\u201d because simply, I feel that way?\nThis is why communication is a must; if you\u2019re not on the same page and it\u2019s a dealbreaker you have to walk away.\nDoesn\u2019t make anyone bad it\u2019s just they\u2019re not the right fit.\nAnd seeing as Taylor easily replaced Joe, saying \u201cI love you\u201d to the worst person (the big toe) who hovered around since the making of Midnights, it\u2019s honestly fair game to him that they didn\u2019t rush into marriage because she just erased the 6 years they spent together by parading that man around and saying things, \u201chappiest she\u2019s ever been.\u201d\nAlso\u2026 Imagine if they had kids brought into this too, fans are already overstepping the boundary by claiming he\u2019s a cheater, and an abuser\u2026 Like\u2026 He\u2019s done nothing besides just broken up with her (most likely) and minded his business like they\u2019re proving him right.\nAnd this is a song that isn\u2019t painting him as a blame, Taylor is one too thus, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t marry me either.\u201d",

To them she is unfailingly perfect and on an impossible to topple pedestal.\nSo when she writes songs where she literally admits to cheating - they do mental gymnastics about how it must be a metaphor for something else. But she's literally been writing songs since Back to December about how she's a big part of the problem in a lot of her relationships and people just refuse to see it.",
            "True, I remember back during RED TV I would explain why Girl at Home isn\u2019t an all girl power anthem, and I would receive mental gymnastic replies because none of them could ever accept the possibility that she\u2019s flawed. Same with High Infidelity, she wrote a song about it, with that title and it\u2019s, \u201cno she didn\u2019t\u201d or \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not autobiographical.\u201d\nEven Red too! That album was Taylor a lot of the times taking the blame. I still think that\u2019s one of her favourite best (and most honest) written albums because it was never \u201coh, you\u2019re the only fault\u201d like they think now.\nAnyways, PREACH.",
            "Is it just me or is the whole criticism of him incredibly vague? Like I can't actually tell what he's supposed to have done wrong here other than I guess not wanting to marry her? If the criticisms of him after such a big deal of a break up are this unspecific then realistically I assume she's not as much of a victim as she's trying to make out. It just seems like this song is supposed to be a slight fuck you to Joe as if he's been an uninterested and uncaring boyfriend yet it doesn't seem to have any substance to make me believe that. If anything, it feels like an attempt to take control of the narrative and act like she's the one that got slighted or she's the one that broke up with him.\nHowever, maybe I'm wrong but considering her post break up spiral I'm a lot less trusting of her point of view on it.",
            "This seems so very heavy handed to place the blame straight on his shoulders. I don\u2019t understand if this is what\u2019s going on why even bother with the \u201cwe grew apart\u201d amicable breakup stories that first came out.\nThen like three weeks it shifted faster than whiplash and everything she\u2019s doing now seems to be one fuck you on top of another fuck you.",
            "She\u2019s been so petty since. From parading the toe wart, to saying I love you to the toe wart, defending him, etc. Having her friends unfollow him, song choices (so fans go nasty on him) it\u2019s sad. She rather let people hate on him then her current loser boyfriend.\nAnd people wonder why \u201che didn\u2019t want to marry her?\u201d\nLike look at the reaction how awful they are about him and how Taylor is behaving like I\u2019d be happy too, and thinking good thing I didn\u2019t propose if my ex is out there with somebody new and saying I love you. It\u2019s a slap.",

            "In most of Western-Europe renting is a lot like owning. \nThe place is unfurnished, you bring your own flooring, wallpaper/paint, appliances and furniture and someone\u2019s residence is sacred (if not outright protected by law in multiple ways).   \nYou\u2019re also allowed to rekey, if the landlord not outright has it rekeyed and hands you all the keys to begin with. \nPart of this is the right to privacy and quiet enjoyment, so the landlord (or maintenance workers) entering uninvited is considered trespassing in all but the most exceptional of circumstances. \nEven if they want to do maintenance they\u2019d have to coordinate with you to make an appointment that suits you and while you\u2019re present, going in without the tenant present is a big no-no.   \nIn the US, if you\u2019re lucky because of some local ordinance, you get a notice 48 hours beforehand at most, often with a time window that encompasses the entire day and if it doesn\u2019t suit you, you\u2019re shit out of luck. \nThe landlord overseas typically doesn\u2019t have a master key, fun side effect of this is that, if you shut yourself out, as is not uncommon with people that aren\u2019t used to the typical latch bolt European front doors have and who pull the door behind them, then the only option is to get a locksmith. \nAnd yes, this means that if there\u2019s some kind of emergency, the landlord would have to call a locksmith.  \nThat said, it\u2019s not uncommon for the landlord to be a big organization and to have one on the payroll and in the 30 odd years of living in a Euro rental I\u2019ve never experienced such a situation, nor have any of the other people who I know that are renting. \nIn fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say that catastrophic events in general seem to be quite rare to the point that I lack any anecdotal stories of myself or that of others. \nCompare that to my experience renting in the US and my current place in a \u201cluxury high rise\u201d had the move-in date postponed by a month because of flooding only to discover 2 months in that it wasn\u2019t properly fixed, causing another flooding. \nSimilarly, raking in premium rent without any concession during all this and during the month long outage of elevators while waiting for parts as a result of a separate flooding, would be completely unheard of in my home country, here it\u2019s pretty normal due to lack of tenant protections. \nTL;DR: privacy > ease of access",

In this case of social anxiety, its something that absolutely shouldnt make you start to hide behind a car to avoid someone you obviously have some sort of personal connection to (given that they have eachothers phone numbers in this situation).\nIdk thats just my two cents, people have to realize that being incapable of handling conversations with other people without having an anxiety attack is not a good thing. The same way its not a good thing to sleep all day because your depression makes it feel impossible to start the day. \nDo i empathize with the people afflicted by these things? Abso-fuckin-lutely!

        "text": "As an OG gacha addict (sadly), it's getting on my nerves how I keep seeing people complain about a lack of things to do, treating this as a main game. I don't know if it's the \"genshin effect\" or the \"mainstream effect\", but a lot of people are missing the point. HSR a gacha\u2014it's not meant to be played and played and played.\n\n&gt; At endgame I play for like 20 minutes per day\n\nThat's the point of a gacha. It's meant to be a low maintenance game that you can still progress.\n\n&gt; There's no content/There's nothing to do\n\nOther than story and small events, the \"content\" of gacha games is passive grinding and being competitive, if not collecting and building units. The main quest not being continued in 1.1 is a different story.  \n\nYou'll only feel there is nothing to do if you binge the content everyday. It's meant to be consumed quickly because the original demographic is people who can play *when* they can, not *because* they can. In fact, feeling there's nothing to is sort of good for us (for me?) because there's no need to worry about needing to spend too much time on the game... \n\n&gt; Filler updates? \n\nUsually it's one of the good things when done right. It gives players time to save, time to catch up on things they didn't have time to do before, time to build, et cetera et cetera.\n\n\nFigure I'm missing a lot more but, you probably get what's been grinding my gears. If you're looking for a game to play for hours, I suggest buying an actual game instead of looking for that in a gacha.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I believe filler updates can be good *usually*. How HSR did it for 1.1 deserves its own discussion and wasn't what I wanted to point out here.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not saying HSR shouldn't strive to have more content. I'm *very* attached to the honkai name, and I'm saying this because I don't want it to become a clusterfuck of content that is genshin which needs weeks of devoted playtime. I already dropped genshin for that\u2014don't want to do the same to a honkai title.",

If you\u2019re interested in the lore and story but don\u2019t want to heavily invest in the gacha, you can just play the main story at your leisure.\nThe rest of the game do require you to build your team, and honestly it\u2019s a cluster due to there a crapload of content as a five year old game. A lot of new players get overwhelmed and burned out trying to do all the events, side stories, open world, weekly bosses, abyss mode\u2026and you do need to pull some meta units to be competitive. If you don\u2019t have a lot of free time to devote to it, either pace yourself or just do the bare minimum for daily/weeklies and call it good.",

            "To add, some story chapters have their own leveling mechanics. In other words, some chapters have their own, self-contained, \"shops\" that give your characters upgrades specifically for that story chapter. The currency for these shops are earned by playing through branches of the story chapter, all f2p of course.\nI felt I had to note that because I failed countless times in the first chapter that did this and accidentally got very good at the game through sheer obstinance.",

            "Yes, and story is really good. It starts out a bit slow but picks up after a few chapters.  You get a lot of free stamina pots as your account levels up so you can pretty much treat it like an offline rpg and play for hours at a time, and come back to it whenever.",
            "you can play HI3 as a playable visual novel just for story without worrying about level up and characters.\nbut its impossible because you will get crystals from login events and wish and starter events, you will just end up doing gacha and with that \"new player luck\" thing you will end up adding this game to another one of your daily gacha list.",
            "The ones I currently play are HSR, Genshin, Arknights, Path to Nowhere, and Summoners War. Arknights and PtN are tower defense gachas; AK is more established with lots of content and is challenging, whereas PtN has more QoL but still is fairly new in content. When I\u2019m not playing HSR and Genshin, AK is the third game that I invest my time in because I\u2019m in love with the community. PtN is one I may drop soon.\nSW is a turn based gacha with auto battle, but I recommend staying away from SW since there\u2019s no pity system and you\u2019re not rewarded for your time. I personally still play just due to a bunch of friends playing. Another similar game is Epic Seven, but is an anime style turn based game with a pity system. Both these games have PvP, which is unfortunately dominated by whales for the most part, but you can just play entirely PvE/Guild content if you want. Both games give lots of pulls as long as you play daily.\nIf you\u2019re interested in HI:3, you might want to check out Punishing: Gray Raven. Similar style to HI:3, but the combat system is unique. Kuro is also coming out with Wuthering Waves, which is similar in style to Genshin.\nOther notable mentions for me are Guardian Tales (extremely F2P friendly), Fate: Grand Order, Fire Emblem: Heroes, FF: Brave Exvius, and Octopath Traveler.",

It\u2019s an idle game, but it has some other, more involved modes, too. I don\u2019t play them much, but I\u2019m not on there to be competitive. \nFate: Grand Order is good, but it has no auto play IIRC. I can\u2019t speak much to it. \nFire Emblem: Heroes was fun, but it\u2019s faaaaaar too much of a money sink for me. \nHonestly, check out r/gachagaming for suggestions to new things coming out.",
            "HI3 is a really great game. The character designs, the story, and even the music are all great. Unfortunately, I dropped it because I can't spare much time anymore. But I suggest you give it a go, if you're into action rpg, you might enjoy it.\nAs for outside of mihoyo, I could recommend Arknights, Guardian Tales, and Limbus Company. These 3 games are also generous when it comes to gacha rates.\nArknights is a tower defense game with a good story, challenging stages, amazing character designs, and phenomenal music. Plus, it has a great community supporting it.\nGT is a pixel style action rpg that's just fun to play, great story, has many pop culture references, easy to grind to and has good comedic writing. The only downside here is that once you reach a certain chapter, the difficulty curve just shot way up.\nAnd Limbus Company is a turn based rpg that was just recently released. I can't really rate this game that much since its kinda new but if you like games made by project moon which are Lobotomy corp. And Library of Ruina, you're gonna like this too since they are in the same universe.",
            "Another Eden is my suggestion. Pretty good to F2P players, as long as you like old school turn-based JRPGs. Gacha is only limited to unlocking characters (and possible stat bonuses if you get duplicate pulls), everything else is a pretty standard single-player game.\nMight be the only Gacha game I've played that really doesn't have a strong FOMO-design anywhere.",

Its merciless as a gacha and while early game, like he first 100 hours you can use lower rarity characters it rampsbup a lot and needs those higher rarities. Farming is rough too.",

If you want something newer and scaled back difficulty-wise, Aether Gazer has held my attention as a mindless fun HI3/PGR clone.\nLimbus Company is fantastic if you\u2019re into that type of style.\nI personally have been enjoying Last Cloudia recently, although you just missed the 4th anniversary where the bulk of the value was for new/returning players.\nProject Neural Cloud and CounterSide are kind of hard to recommend right now, but both are good games if you enjoy their aesthetic or combat style.",

It doesn't need to have a new area, it doesn't even have to end it, just something to talk about for the next six weeks. I seriously doubt the companion quests are going to be anything more than what we already have - I expect some good character moments, but nothing especially intriguing.\nI'm still going to stick with the game because I imagine this is just a temporary hiccup while things are still early. God knows Genshin gave people fuck all to do during 1.x and by later 3.x people were complaining about having way too much to do. Hopefully it's the same here because I actually care about the story this time and would like to at least have more of it on a consistent basis.\nI guess at least there's Limbus Season 2 to tide me over when it comes to the plot department.

However, even tho I can play it for however long I want and still be able to make meaningful progress, it still doesn't fulfill my cravings for genshin or HSR.

Genshin may have an \"overwhelming\" amount of content, but even if you have several weeks worth of quests and exploration to go, you'll still feel like you're running out of meaningful progression if your current main goal is to power up that limited 5 star character you just got, along with all the other characters needed for the main team you have in mind for them.

There is story, and probably enough playtime to compare with an average RPG you'd get elsewhere.\nPerhaps not now, but after a year or two, it'll be at least a full 60 to 80 hour title, which is what one would expect for an RPG.\nThis is not much different from playing a game in early access, where the devs have only completed a quarter of the story and looking to finance their small indie studio.",
            "Expecting unlimited story updates every 6 weeks in a free game is not realistic.\nI love turn-based RPGs. I finished Persona 5 in a week. Bought it on release day at 60 USD. Do I whine and moan about how there's no more content once the credits roll?\nNo. \nHSR is a free RPG game with good production values. Even if there's only 1 new planet per year (and that's exactly what's gonna happen), it's still worth playing as a 10-minute a day side game.",

            "I mean I\u2019ve had gachas be my main game plenty of times before. Brave Frontier, Dragalia Lost, even FEH and FGO; All of those games had plenty of content (FEH and FGO a little less so) at all times, certainly plenty enough for a main game. Being a gacha isn\u2019t an excuse for not having enough rewarding repeatable content.\nThat being said, the game is brand new, and you can\u2019t really judge it for that this early on. However, given Mihoyo\u2019s track record in Genshin, I can understand why people would be apprehensive. I\u2019ll reserve my judgement for a few months, but at the end of the day, there are a million and one ways that gachas can create engaging content that can certainly make them capable of being a \u201cmain game.\u201d",
            "Brave Frontier: Powercreep, pvp, dead.\nDragalia Lost: 3D chibi ver of granblue, coop grinding hell, dead.\nFEH: powercreept, pvp.\nFGO: dead weeks, dead months, no rerun, 3weeks event, not even a remake animation, road to 7 is plenty of content?? lmao.",
            "It\u2019s really is amazing how much money fgo makes though. Since the story is  so good.",
            "I'll give it to FGO, the story updates are really satisfying and feel complete when released compared to Genshin, and hell most other gachas. Even the event stories feel self contained and substantial, even if 80% of a particular event was just jokes and memes.",
            "Man dragalia lost was legit my main game, even more than Duel Links lmao. Honestly, it was a lot of grinding but at least it was interactive grinding for me and I could solo farm all content. Plus the game was very f2p too, I had every limited character + collab. Sad it got shut down.",
            "I find that in most cases, gacha games tend to use competitive modes to make repeatable content as a \"main game\". At least that's how how HI3 became mine. Obviously that won't work in HSR/GI which are heavily whale-biased (less on HSR) because of Eidolons/Constellations/Superimpositions/whatever so it's hard to imagine how these can be made into main games without sacrificing the low-maintenance characteristic.",
            "You mean like all pvp games as a service games?\nMan how does valorant or apex make repeatable content\u2026",
            "Fighting games in shambles right now",
            "While HI3 did have, if not PvP, an endgame that offered rewards based on whether you could beat other players' times (thus heavily advantaging whales), I really like that Genshin didn't, and that plenty of F2P players can still full-star Abyss.\nI'd love to see HSR lean into the SU with more content, which is IMO by far the most interesting format for potential endgame, rather than just an MoC/Abyss.",
            "I disagree with this. I think there are gacha games that are pushing the limits of daily content available to the player. Gacha games like Dislyte & Summoners War have many events that feel rewarding and reward the player with completing battle scenarios. \nSomething missing from Genshin which seems to have translated down to HSR is that one you complete the story/location completion, there is little to no reward for returning to re-complete areas. They would be wise to add an event coin or reward system that incentivizes searching areas, random battle scenarios, and providing low chance drop rewards on materials that are gated behind the resin wall that exists in both games. As long as the rewards are worthwhile, people will do it. \nBeing used to the system that\u2019s been provided and adapting to it and settling for what exists is how these companies fail into cash grab categories. I wish they would provide more insight into the feedback players give and try something different rather than stick with the genshin\u2019s approach. Push the limits is my feedback to the devs.",
            "Agreed, the low daily time commitment is what drew me to Gacha in the first place (RIP to both Love Live's ending service in a couple month span...). I don't really have or want to spend the time to keep up with a big MMO, but a few minutes a day during free time is nice. The thing I feel players new to the genre also struggle with is trade offs - at least in the gacha's I've played it's never possible to get or level every character without dropping huge $; you can't just grind out a dungeon for hours on end due to resource constraints.",
            "> That's the point of a gacha. It's meant to be a low maintenance game that you can still progress.\nThat's the point of an idle game, no? The point of a gacha game is that most of the player's ability to progress is gated behind pulls, but there is no reason to pull, if there is nothing to pull for.",
            "I do get your point, but not adding main story is actually just trolling because everything else in this game consists of autoplayable content lol.\nEven the event was easily completeable with just autoplay because it added no mechanics that really influence the gameplay.\nYou're pretty much just logging in to autoplay 10 minutes and quit. They HAVE to increase the pace of main story content or I don't see a reason to be invested in this game at all.",
            "Don't let MTashed see this.",
            "Dude it's ok for people to have personal opinions about a game. Genre conventions are not necessarily good things. Blindly defending something with \"it's a gacha!\" is the ignorant thing to do, not voicing a complaint with a game.",
            "It's gacha, can't have gameplay getting in the way of my monetization!",
            "This is no excuse for dried up content. People like you and the 1.5k people who upvoted your post are the reason why a game can treat it's players like shit and get away with it. I honestly don't know how you can even defend this garbage relic farming system. It's so bad having to wait for so long just to get a half decent drop. But yeah let's make them restrict all of our gameplay because \"it is a gacha\". Dumbass.",

            "The game might be a gacha but that can't mean that we aren't allowed to express our desire for more content because the game is good enough to be more than just a gacha\nThat said, there are some gacha games that offer more repeatable content accessible without their version of fuel. Maybe those games weren't as lucrative as hoyoverse games but at the same time, but at the same time maybe HSR could be more profitable if I spent more time in-game wishing I could pull.",
            "You left the most important part. They intentionally leave you without things to do so that you get bored and spend money for that excitement. They don't do it out of the kindness or respect for your time.",
            "Meh. I wish the artifacts/relics farming cost zero resin/TP so Genshin/HSR can be turned into grindy main games(by personal choice). Just like Onmyoji, it's a gacha but ppl can choose to spend hours farming souls and EXPs. \nAnd...I mean...with the rate of getting decent artifacts/relics so LOW it would be better this way. I have 13 five star chars in Genshin that can't be used cause I got no artifacts for them. AND! I ain't having any high standards I just want the correct MAIN stats artifacts. Yet Hoyo can't even fulfill that simple need. It's actually fucked up and unreasonable. Bro, those are 13 characters that I paid couple thousands dollars for. I'd be so happy to grind all day so the contents I paid for can actually be used in game.",
            "I think it's weird behavior for gacha veterans to get all high and mighty and sneer at the people who love the game and just want to play it more but can't due to the gacha limitations. People are allowed to be unhappy even if this is par for the course in gacha. You're not better than anyone just because you're content with the status quo.",
            "I think the main problem is that HSR is available for PC. If HSR was strictly a mobile game I think 90% of these complaints disappear, but not only is it available on PC but advertised as a 'space fantasy rpg'. So people go in expecting an rpg's worth of content only to get walled after one and a half-ish arcs and be left with no replayable content once their allotment of energy is expended.\nPC gamers (at least, like me and my friends) aren't the type to load up a game, play for 5 minutes, and then close it. We load up a game to play it for 30+ minutes. The only niche that HSR would fill is that of an idle game, which it doesn't work as either due to not having anything to be idly doing while waiting for other people to show up once you've finished your dailies.\nIt's a shame, because it has the production value. Everyone that plays it agrees that it looks fantastic, but ironically enough, it falls into the same trap that most AAA games have. As soon as you clear the first portion of the game where trailers and demos took place (Belobog, in HSR's case), the quality starts to nosedive. You only get half of an arc after that and then you're stuck in gacha daily hell, which I think understandably leaves a sour taste in people's mouths.",

            "I don't think the filler patches are wrong, what i think is wrong is that it's in 1.1 xD\nThat they were going to continue with the main story seemed like a fact to me, the totally logical decision xD\nNow i'm thinking that i don't even remember at what point we finished the story, for within 2 months (if it continues in 1.2) i'll have completely forgotten what we were doing, i'll have the characters maxed out and i'll be in the loop of simply farming better stats in the artifacts to advance in the abyss xD\nI find it hard to believe that they give us a patch worse than Genshin 1.1 xD basically they are giving us the bare minimum of a normal gacha game patch, it doesn't seem that we are still in the honeymoon phase.",
            "No way. These people are literally the same as genshin. They want to defend their game always. Its insane.\nIf they do something it's always right. They can't be wrong.

            "Actually, I don't think Genshin or Honkai are marked with \"In game gambling\" anywhere. It's not a gacha because of that, and that's just false advertising, hence why players have the criticism against it.",
            "To be fair, those who complain, they are mostly gacha players. Real game players don't expect a game to be constantly updated with new contents, they are actually the ones who wait and chill. Only gacha players do complain, because to be fair, the game is relatively lacking in ways to bullshit your time with it's trashy progression system yet, comparing to other gachas.",
            "Gacha is just a mechanic.  I haven\u2019t played many, but awhile back I played Granblue Fantasy for 3 years straight, and you literally never ran out of things to do if you wanted to.  You could always grind SOMETHING if you wanted to, and there was always new stuff to do.  So it sounds more like you play a bunch of shitty low-content gacha games.",
            "Yes and no. Sure Gacha games aren't meant to be played for hours on end.........BUT, GI/HSR are even worse than the league average. Because at least other games have PVP, Guild content, etc. HSR literally just has story. Simulated universe was fun at first, but at this point, everything's on auto. Only thing to strive for, for most players right now, is memory of chaos. But once you beat that? Your ONLY insensitive to get on throughout the week, is min maxing gear, so you can auto MoC lol and just wait for new story. \nAnd it's even harder to stay on HSR, than it was for GI, because at least in Genshin I could put my new character in the squad and just fart around the open world.",
            "Moronic post. \"this game is X genre so you have to accept that it does Y\". \nWrong. There's no law in the universe that dictates \"rules\" of game design. Players have to constantly demand better or devs/publishers will continue to give us the bare minimum they can. Quit being a bootlicker and start advocating for your own interests instead of against them.",
            "I had to learn that the hard way with Genshin.\nThis is why I am going my own slow ass pace this time.",
            "I think pretty much any newly released major gacha has these kind of complaints at this point. Speaking of which, I was actually looking at a YouTube video just now presenting all the Main Quest + Companion Quest and there are like 15 hours of cutscenes + dialogues, this is excluding actual gameplay. I understand people will be disappointed if 1.1 comes out without new Main Story update (I was definitely looking forward to it too) but casual players who play 1 hour a day (or less) might not even have catch up with current content, let alone be ready for new one."

Credit cards should be active for more than a year with good credit standing before we can proceed with the request.\"",

Kung wala kang payments, hindi pwede magtemporary increase kasi after ng temporary increase period mo, babalik sa regular limit mo yung account which would result to overlimit kaya hindi siya pwede unless nagbayad ka to intentionally increase. So if you actually made payments, you may clarify that with the phonebanker.",

I have another question tho, in case you know the answer, pwede bang tumawid yung temporary increase sa next cycle ng SOA? for example, may payments before 15th, so may soa na after, then tuloy parin travel so next cycle na yung sunod na transactions.\nThanks and advance kind redditor",

One where you can input directly from Ebay (although powered by PayPal as well so it would redirect to PayPal but you won\u2019t need a PayPal account); and the other method is you login thru PayPal first tapos dun ka maginput ng card details or if it\u2019s a saved card, select the card lang. \nHaven\u2019t proven my theory yet. Siguro Ill try on another smaller transaction hehe, but if you login with PayPal and use your CC there, it only creates 1 transaction and that\u2019s how I got it to be approved. \nSo thru Ebay without PayPal account: 2 transactions - 1 approved and 1 declined\nThru PayPal directly with PayPal account: 1 transaction and it gets approved. \nWill do a test for this and post an update nalang para sure tayo haha",

They already destroyed, prayed over (my dad and his brother was a Christian na that time) and burned his paraphernalia and his little house where he performs the healing yet my lolo is still alive.

But I can see why they'd think this way, because living in a remote place, there is nothing else around you except nature. Sounds of wind, animals scurrying, and shadows can play tricks on your mind. Science is a farfetched concept because they were barely introduced where they were so anything that cannot explained by hard facts is attributed to the \"unseen\".\nRegarding speaking in different languages. That's pretty common here where regional dialects are not simply a matter of different accents. Filipinos are good at absorbing languages because we are a commercial hub.

Any statements made prior to being placed in custody and not in response to interrogation are admissible.

            "When they broke up, I got heavily downvoted for guessing that they split over the marriage issue. I thought it was pretty obvious that she got sick of waiting for him to propose. The switch up from paper rings to Lavender Haze was very telling imo",
            "It\u2019s a very safe bet that most break ups at their ages, after being together for many years, is caused by a difference about marriage or children.",
            "Yep. Exactly. At that age it's clear what you want and if the other person is ultimately not on the same page it's basically the end.",
            "it was so obvious and people who said things like \"god forbid a woman change her mind about the institute of marriage\" were totally projecting their feelings onto taylor. who always has and always will want that life.",
            "The way those who said \u2018hey maybe she wanted marriage and he didn\u2019t\u2019 got downvoted to hell",
            "Yeah, i remember seeing a large post that was like \u201cthank you for validating me\u2014I KNEW she wouldn\u2019t really want to get married and have kids because she ALREADY is living her dream and she just had to grow up to realize it.\u201d  So many other comments echoing the same thing. I was pretty surprised since Taylor is pretty much the opposite of \u201csingle lady for life\u201d.",
            "Same. I pointed out she went from Lover being her wedding vows and Lavender Haze to her rewriting the narrative and being a huge cope, and I got people telling me she\u2019s a storyteller and supposed to create a narrative. \nHe dumped her. I theorize he wasn\u2019t proposing and she got restless so she emotionally cheated with the racist and then he dumped her.",
            "What makes her think matty will marry her? Dude sounds like a nightmare\nI dont honestly buy the copium theory lmao but again idk whats real.",
            "Honestly I don\u2019t think she thinks Matty is gonna marry her either. I think Matty is just an ill advised rebound she\u2019s having a manic period over when you want to feel petty and vindictive to your ex. It\u2019s the high of getting one over someone who hurried you and wanting to beat them to the punch. \nIt\u2019s actually the most relatable she\u2019s ever been because I\u2019ve pulled something like that with a long time ex and rebounds tend to have this high that will either be the best thing that ever happens or the worst. On top of that, she\u2019s right to leave a relationship if he\u2019s not gonna marry her at this stage in her life (likewise he\u2019s right to not want to marry her since career wise he just started). \nThe bad part is that she choose a disgusting racist to have the rebound with and is doubling down on it. \nBut yeah Lavender Haze was a total cope and she\u2019s going through the motions of scorched earth + self pitying to make her look like a victim.",
            "If she's in a \"i wouldn't marry me either\" insecurity spiral, she might've thought \"fuck it\" and went for the bad boy rebound cuz none of it matters anyway if no one wants her (\"who could ever leave me darling, but who could stay?\"), so why bother searching for The One if there isn't gonna be one? Especially spending all these years expecting Joe to be Her Forever Person, this must be a blow to what she thought her life was gonna be. She must be in a very delicate place right now, keeping her head up for the tour and having to deal with this at home.",
            "It's also a little of the \"oh you don't want me because of XYZ? I'm going to be even more XYZ.\"",
            "Imo the whole matty thing looks like a reputation era like press. Idk. I do think she doesn't deserve the level of backlash for dating him because she's getting more shit than HE is. Priority needs to be right \nI wish she did not see this clown at all! But it is what it is. She's not perfect person  and this isn't the worst thing a celeb has done",
            "She\u2019s getting more shit because she\u2019s one of the biggest pop stars ever and has therefore platformed him and is having a proportional response. On top of that, she\u2019s made feminism a part of her brand and then chooses to date a racist misogynist. Adding even more to that, she\u2019s whitewashing him to make him PR acceptable (having the podcast taken down, creating stan twitter accounts back in march, adding and cleaning up his Wikipedia page, ice spice collab) so she\u2019s enabling his bs. \nMatty is disgusting and needs to go but she shares a good portion of blame for choosing to date him and cleaning up his messes when he\u2019s made it abundantly clear he dgaf about being a dirtbag.",
            "I think the backlash against them both should be worse. \n>She's not perfect person and this isn't the worst thing a celeb has done\nI feel like this just gives her exactly the kind of pass she's hoping her fans will give her that she doesn't deserve. There will always be worse but that doesn't make this any better imo.",
            "even worse were the ones saying they broke up because SHE didn\u2019t want to get married. duuude.",
            "I got downvoted too. Marriage truthers stand up \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude05 \nThis is so sad but couldn't be more obvious from how she's been acting on stage. Even telling us \"this is how you propose!\" She wanted him to marry her but even more, I think she wanted him to \"fight\" for her by giving her what I imagine is an immense amt of attn and validation. She's A LOT and I think she knows that and Joe def knew it.\nAnd I even understand her saying she's the happiest now bc she probably feels liberated to be herself essentially and isn't chasing her boyfriend's love and attn and commitment, not getting it, and feeling desperate and angry all the time.",
            "Yeah, Lavender Haze was a big revelation for me. She went from wanting to marry him throughout Lover, to wanting to have kids with him in Folklore to all of a sudden being completely apathetic and tired of hearing about marriage from the press? Huh? She's been processing this for a while, I think.",
            "I got called misogynistic by her stans for saying it was probably cause he didn\u2019t wanna marry her. They insisted that Lavender Haze negated basically every other song from her where she loudly proclaimed she wanted marriage. As if Lavender Haze isn\u2019t what every girl who wants to get married but is compromising and telling herself she doesn\u2019t want it says",
            "The way she tried to swerve so hard in Lavender Haze\u2026add me to the \u201cI got downvoted\u201d squad",
            "Yes, I just said this exact thing on the Taylor Swift sub. Why are people so determined to ignore songs like Lover and Paper Rings? She wanted to get married and he didn\u2019t and that killed their relationship.\nIf there\u2019s one consistent thing about Taylor over all different her eras, it\u2019s that she\u2019s deeply romantic and loves to love effusively and publicly. Multiple albums contain lyrics mentioning and hoping for marriage. At its core, a wedding is about two people publicly proclaiming their love for \u201cevermore\u201d lol. Do we really think she doesn\u2019t want that, deep down? She comes from a pretty conservative background too.",
            "I don't think it was just marriage though. Although that was the final nail imo. I think it was that attention and validation, and liking and wanting her to be A LOT. She's A LOT, everyone knows it, and I think he really wasn't into it bc he's just a normal and chill regular guy. The marriage thing was just the cherry and what really made her feel unloved imo.\nI also think she was upset and bothered he wasn't there for the big events like walking red carpets and her graduation from NYU. I always thought that but was told over and over she likes the privacy too \ud83d\ude44 No she does not whatsoever.",
            "I got downvoted too for saying taylor probably wanted him to show up for her publicly. \u201cshe\u2019s in her 30s\u201d they said to me. so what? I think no matter your age you\u2019ll want your partner to claim you proudly, to support you every step of the way.",
            "lol there was another couple who got comments like that on this sub (runs and hides) but i\u2019m sorry even the relationship is 1000 years old, I want to be loved out loud and it\u2019s just human.\nlike obviously the public shouldn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s your love blah blah but for people acting as if they won\u2019t want a little public declaration from a man that is basically immortalised and will always be part of their discography/work/interviews are lying to themselves.",
            "THANK YOU. I got downvoted so much for saying that it\u2019s weird he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge her at all in stuff. It\u2019s like guys who never post their longterm girlfriend on instagram, what is the point in hiding it?",
            "ITA with all of this! She ruminates about this exact thing in so many different songs. Some put a happy spin on it like Me but her fear that she\u2019s too much for him and that\u2019s why she\u2019ll lose him is visible in many songs.",
            "And the choice of the new guy makes perfect sense too based on this. People hate to see it but she's telling us the WHY WHY WHY as clear as day imo.",
            "Lavender Haze was so obliviously cope coming from her because she was obsessed with Joe and never wanted to let him go, so at the time she was willing to not get married just to stay with him. This is the same girl who has fantasized and written about marriage since she was a teenager, she is clearly at least in love with the idea of getting married. Then she went on to write songs like Lover and Paper Rings where she\u2019s literally \u201cmarry me, Joe!\u201d Anyone who thought she suddenly left all those feelings behind and is now all like \u201cI don\u2019t need marriage after all\u201d we\u2019re always fooling themselves.",
            "What does \u201ccope\u201d mean in this context? I\u2019ve seen it a couple times in this thread and I\u2019m unfamiliar. And probably just old.",
            "This made me laugh. To me, it means she was trying to convince herself she didn't want marriage either bc Joe didn't. Basically she was trying to make herself happy (cope/deal with the disappointment) with their current status with LH, but ultimately couldn't get there ofc. You can't fool your own self forever.",
            "Also the People breakup article mentioned they were talking about marriage a few months before the breakup and clearly the talks didn't go well. I did think that was a weird thing to include in a breakup article too",
            "as someone in her age group i thought the same thing. i saw her stans saying that he probably wanted to get married and she didn\u2019t want to and so she broke up with him and i was like lmao girl do you really buy every narrative this woman tries to sell you",
            "I feel like we're witnessing a PR death spiral what is going on",
            "This is her trying to regain the narrative and turn herself into the victim because that's when she profits. There's no real self awareness in this song, no understanding why someone might hesitate to marry her. Instead she's the \"bravest little soldier\". \ud83d\ude44\nListen I like Taylor's music but she has a major case of arrested development. In Evermore and Folklore she was praised for being able to go beyond mining her romantic life for material and use original characters. But most of those original characters were in their teens/early 20s, which I feel is telling about her mindset. Still it was different. Then with Midnights she was praised for her maturity and introspection (however she went back to mining her romantic relationships for material). \nSince she broke up with Joe, that tiny bit of growth seems to be out the window. \nTaylor for love of God, go to therapy.",
            "That line about fighting his army... bruh... he's not the one with fans willing to go to war for him. That's you honey and yes, IT IS a lot.",
            "Tbh can you imagine marrying someone with a fanbase like hers? It wears me down reading their comments daily and I\u2019m nobody.",
            "the lyric is actually \u201cfighting in only your army\u201d according to genius and they\u2019re the only one who get hozier lyrics right so i trust them. she\u2019s saying she\u2019s fighting for him, not with him.",
            "It reminded me of Brooke Davis in One Tree Hill (lmao a teenage character!), telling Lucas \u201cI wanted you to FIGHT for me.\u201d And I feel like Joe\u2019s perspective might be something like \u201cbut why does it need to be a fight?\u201d",
            "The Ice Spice collab didn\u2019t do its job so she needs to revictimize herself the best way she knows how - blaming her ex for her failed relationships with a poor me put upon narrative. And Swifties are eating it up and back on the FUCK JOE train instead of paying attention to Taylor dating a racist.",
            "Didn\u2019t this come out at the same time as that collab? Confused at how your imagining this timeline. Unless I\u2019m confused! Thought they were both new releases today.",
            "They were released at the same time so you\u2019re right it\u2019s just a coincidence/suspiciously timed but the Ice Spice thinkpieces have been happening for the past 48 hours and are not having a positive spin. HuffPo and one other big name mag escapes me dropped two pieces on it and PR scrambled to drop fluff pieces with People about her and Matty kissing to distract and now she\u2019s got this song to distract even further. \nEven Swifties think this song was written in the past few weeks.",
            "I think she's throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks at this point, just to save face...",
            "Where are you seeing swifites doing that? Because I\u2019ve been following the reaction and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing lmao. Sometimes yall just be talkin ngl. I get the Matty Healy thing gets an emotional reaction out of people but I think it\u2019s time to log off.\nThe songs were released at the same time and had to have been planned a long time ago for the vinyls.",
            "these lyrics fucking suck",
            "Yeah they\u2019re just not good\u2026 the phoenix rising from the ashes and the bravest soldier bits just read as so cliche and basic. Very surface-level metaphors. Her lyrics always just strike me as shallow and lacking any real depth. To me, her writing feels like a pseudo-intellectual, I\u2019m so deep teenager who\u2019s spent too much time with a thesaurus.",
            "oh my god thank you! I\u2019m always so scared to voice this because I have swiftie friends but she writes like the kid with the best grade in her high school English class and that\u2019s it. I thought her work in folklore/evermore finally was such an improvement, but I think that is more Aaron Dessner than anyone else (or maybe Joe/William Bowery \ud83d\ude09)",
            "Evermore and folklore are the only two albums where I thought she was consistently strong as a writer the whole way through. The others, she had some clever turns of phrase or catchy moments (and definitely way more than the average pop star) but I wouldn\u2019t have said she was amazing. Midnights felt like a step back to me.",
            "Yes! I\u2019m not sure why but there\u2019s a train of thought that her use of \u201caltruism\u201d and \u201cMachiavellian\u201d in her songs is evidence of her craft. Idk, I think it\u2019s lazy.",
            "I like Folklore a lot but I actually think her songwriting was better when it was younger because it was simultaneously detailed and sincere. Some of her modern choices feel a lot more convoluted and tryhard. At least in \"Anti-Hero\" it's what she was going for, but just because your song is about being a wreck doesn't mean it's enjoyable to listen to lyrics that sound like a wreck.\nAgain there is a lot to like in \"Folklore\" but there are some bad lyrics that really take me out of the album. \"Fearless\" is a mood with no whiplash.",
            "The Lakes reads like a 15yo\u2019s poetry.",
            "I always think of London Boy when she says \u201cthey say home is where the heart is but that\u2019s not where mine lives\u201d when what she means in the song is literally just home is where the heart is, that\u2019s exactly what the expression means. The verse only makes sense if she thinks the expression means that your heart is always at your official home or something which is crazy for someone who\u2019s so proud to have worked with words her whole life. She sometimes just drops common expressions in her lyrics with no twist to them which is super lazy to me but this is one time she should\u2019ve just done that instead if she wanted it there!!!\nedited because of phone autocorrect",
            "I think it\u2019s always funny when people act like her allusions are deep and scholarly, when in reality she\u2019s just referencing a lot of AP English reads.",
            "I think she's a fun storyteller (because I think the ultimate test of that is what emotions you invoke in your audience, and for better or worse she's good at that) but I assume the people who praise her writing over all else also think those little pinterest couplets are the peak of poetry.",
            "I honestly don't think she's a fun storyteller because I don' tthink she has enough life perspective to tell any... like... compelling stories. Her entire narrative is just \"I'm the victim,\" \"Maybe I'm a victim... of me?,\" \"Romance,\" \"Romacne is hard,\" and \"Fame is hard.\"\nThere lacks a grit and reality that anyone who has lived outside of her weird lil bubble would actually gravitate towards. Her lyrics have always read like someone who got their undertanding of life through cash and scrolling tumblr at 3am.",
            "I feel like she just churned this out to make money off her break up buzz lol",
            "I've literally always said this and I'm glad to see it here. It's needless complexity that detracts from the message instead of adds. I used to be into poetry and can confirm as a teenager my peers were capable of churning out stuff equal to her lyrics.",
            "Yeah it seems like she uses overly flowery language in an effort to sound poetic, but it ends up just feeling clunky and lacking flow. It never really feels earnest or sincere to me.",
            "Every time Swifties make a post like \"other singers expressing things vs Taylor Swift\", it's like a normal phrase like \"I broke your heart\" and lists of Taylor's similes and metaphors as if other songwriters don't... use descriptive language in their lyrics too???",
            "I actually think her lyrics are shallow, cliche & basic because she is. She\u2019s surrounded herself with a bunch of yes people, people are afraid to criticise her, and if they do she just cries misogyny.\nShe throws cheap lines in like \u201cI wouldn\u2019t marry me either\u201d but every other line is about how she\u2019s poured herself into the relationship & done absolutely nothing wrong. The lyrics completely lack introspection - she can\u2019t help but see herself as the victim.",
            "All her lyrics are juvenile and read like 8th grade poetry night but stans act like she\u2019s Fiona Apple or something.",
            "Omg I just figured out y it irks me when she gets praised for her elementary level use of metaphors and songwriting. Some of her songs, especially her earlier stuff were very catchy, undoubtedly, and I know how to appreciate catchy. \nBut the songwriting? It\u2019s ALWAYS been meh to me. People will recite a lyric of hers and cry and I\u2019ll think it\u2019s so heavy-handed. \nAnd now I\u2019m beginning to think it\u2019s because of songwriters like Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Lauryn Hill, Nina Simone, Bjork, Imogen Heap, and Regina Spektor exist. Like with those artists, I\u2019ll keep going back to their albums and find a different layer and have an \u201cepiphany\u201d moment over and over again. \nHeck even Christina Aguilera\u2019s, \u201cFighter\u201d, is so slept on terms of its lyricism. Very simple yet powerful. (And it\u2019s her best MV, imo) \nWith Fiona Apple, I know some don\u2019t like this song but, \u201cLeft Alone\u201d, has one of my favourite lyrics:\n\u201cMy ills are reticulate \nMy woes are granular \nThe ants weigh more than the elephants\u201d\n\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\nI\u2019m sorry I went off on a tangent, I was just enthralled at seeing praise for Fiona Apple and got carried away. \ud83d\ude05",
            "It blows my mind still that Swift was the female singer songwriter who blew up like this. Tori Amos's Little Earthquakes, Fiona Apple's When The Pawn, Patty Griffin's Living With Ghosts just eat up everything Swift has ever done. No break up song Swift has written will ever sound as angry, honest and self critical than a Fiona Apple song. None of her faux feministy growing and listening to yourself type song will ever touch Little Earthquakes. And the crazy thing is when I was growing up as a fan of female singer songwriters they couldn't get a good review from the male rock dominated music papers for love or money. Were always described as being self obsessed narcissists pushing the same old same old. The reviews Fiona Apple used to get by dudes are just insane by today's standards.",

Why seemingly  go after Joe with all the pap walks, articles, concert actions, Matty stuff, etc. if they simply just grew apart and wanted different things from life? Taylor acting this way just makes her look like a \u201cnice girl\u201d who think she deserves the world because she thinks she\u2019s the best ever. I also simply don\u2019t trust or believe her anymore after the events from the past few weeks so I\u2019m taking her lyrics with huge grains of salt at this point, her artistry and lyricism has taken a huge hit to me because I can no longer see her as a reliable narrator. No amount of songs will ever convince me that Joe didn\u2019t break things off and it would not shock me if it was due to Taylor and Matty being closer much earlier than we\u2019re being led to believe.",

            "Statistically, there's basically no such thing as stranger danger. Almost all cases of child abduction, murder, and sexual assault come at the hands of a family member or someone known to and trusted by the family. Like, high 90%s.\nStrangers are statistically an order of magnitude safer than non-strangers.\nKids should be taught to be skeptical and careful who they talk to and what situations they get into. They should be taught about consent and autonomy, and all that good stuff. If someone says this or makes you feel that way, then tell someone you trust, like me, or a teacher, etc. But ultimately, focusing on strangers versus people they know is more likely to do harm than good.\nMy point is just that we take this for granted because of various propoganda and fear-mongering by news outlets serving the interests of their views and shareholders, and such. But the reality is a bit horrifying, and demands a different approach.\nConsider a child opening up to a trusted adult about the priest molesting them. Think how often that trusted adult will have known and trusted the priest, and won't take the allegation seriously.",
            "Another detail to that, if a child is raised to fear asking strangers for help then in an emergency they're on their own until someone decides to approach them.\nThis is a great way to select for the wrong people.",
            "Excellent point. Yes. Well put. It's the serial killer who will know to pretend that the child's parents told them to pick them up, and such.",
            "It's a good idea to tell your children who to approach when they're lost. I always told mine to approach another mother with kids. If there wasn't one, a dad with kids. Then, a lady by herself or a worker that you knew worked there (like they're behind a counter).\nAnd that they always needed to stay in the same area where we were last together, never wander looking for us or let themselves be taken to a new location. We (the adults would do the running around like maniacs.)\nThe two times in 12 years that it happened, it worked (with both 3 minute incidents shaving years off my life, but that's parenthood).",
            "I agree with all this except the assertion that there no such thing as stranger danger. Yes, stranger abductions are more rare, but they do exist and they're something to educate your kids about. \nI was at a park/splash pad with my kids and watched a woman get out of a rattle trap car that just pulled up. It seemed odd because she was at least older 50s with no kids and she didn't seem all there cognitively. She walked up with a cute dog on a leash (there was no dog park nearby, dogs weren't allowed in this area). She proceeds to drag this dog around like she'd never walked a dog in her life.\nAnyways, she comes near me and goes up to a random 3-4 year old kid and asks if he wants to pet her dog. The kid says no and walks away. The lady looks back at the car, shrugs like \"what now?\" Driver guy gestures as if to say, move around, try again. She chooses a different child and starts towards them. Since I've been watching my own kids, I've mentally matched up this child with a parent nearby, but the kid's parent is distracted by their older child. So I move closer, all while watching my own kids. It must've spooked the dog lady, because she dragged the dog back out to the car and they drove off.\nI called the cops and gave a description of them, the car and dog, and what happened.\nThree days later the two were arrested at a different park in the next town for trying something similar.",

He later sees cop cars outside the restaurant and the kid's mom brings the cops over to him claiming he molested her child because the kid said he saw this guy's penis in the bathroom.\nHe gets arrested, his date that was going well is ruined and this story is spread all over his university. He loses his scholarship and has to drop out. He is eventually cleared of charges even though the mother kept trying to escalate and accuse this guy, but the damage is done. He said it took him over a decade to recover from how much this incident ruined his life.\nI'll see if I can find the original post and link it.

I don't think it's really fair to put that on a kid.  \"You reported your Creepy Uncle for molesting you, so now we're going to KILL him.  Your uncle is going to die because you didn't keep your mouth shut.\"  If a kid DOES let that prevent them from turning him in, then the law is worse than useless.  It's actually helping the bad guy.  And if a kid doesn't let that prevent them from turning him in, and the uncle gets executed, that's probably not going to be really great for the kid's emotional well being.",

            "And that's a lot of the problem I have with the death penalty in practice. It's all well and good to say that you want to kill murderers and rapists and other terrible people, but the government convicts innocent people all the time. Even worse, there seem to be prosecutors who either have no problem with killing innocent people or who will even actively commit misconduct to ensure innocent people get convicted, and they don't even face any real consequences. And there's a lot of ways that the system closes ranks to protect prior convictions, even when misconduct or exonerating evidence later comes out.\nAnd that's even without considering all of the people who take guilty pleas, even though they're innocent, because they're looking at the possibility of being put to death if they fight the charges and they can't bear to take that risk.",

            "Yes, it will absolutely lead to child rapists also killing the child. But it could also lead to innocent people being put to death. The death penalty should be abolished for that reason alone. The fact that several other good reasons can be added to that is a sign, surely.",

            "Plus the fact that Republicans are on a major crusade at the moment to declare LGBT+ folks as groomers and child molesters seems concerningly relevant to this whole thing.",
            "Disagree.  If you make the punishment for molestation the same as for murder, then the perp is more likely to murder the child after the act, and not leave a witness.",
            "I would have to see the language of the bill to come to a conclusion on this. The term \"child molester\" makes you think grown adult perving on a grade school age child. Unfortunately, the law isn't so black and white. How many teenage couples are two years apart and a year away from being executed by the state? Language is everything.",
            "I'll never forget a story I read 25 odd years ago about a single father of two daughters.    He was always taking picture of them.   One day one of the girls 'mooned' him as a joke while he was taking a picture.    THe company that developed the film reported him to the police.   It was the only 'nude' photo of his daughter that they found when they raided his house.    At the trail (yes this actually made it to a trial)  they put into evidence that he had Playboy magazines in his room and that this somehow proved he was a sexual deviant.     This one innocent picture taken accidentally just ruined this guys life.   Not to mention his daughters lives.     If I remember correctly, once all his money was gone and his house was sold to pay for lawyers, the guy plead out to a lesser charge.    Don't remember if he got custody of his daughters back.\nMoral is that the government can't be trusted to be reasonable and fair with emotional subjects like this.   Once they become politicized, then justice goes out the window.   THere are already plenty of laws against child molestation.   DOn't need a death penalty.\nEDIT: they won't let me post a link but google: how a photo can ruin your life.",
            "This reminds me of a job I did once. I was a private investigator and got a case where an insurance company wanted me to film a house one day to see if someone showed up, but when I got there there were young children running around in the sprinklers completely naked. \nI called in and told them, \"yeah, I can't film here\" and spent the next 30 minutes trying to explain that no, I won't just take a photo of the naked children to email them to show why I couldn't film there because that was just as illegal. \nNo clue how that case ended, I left and never went back.",

            "Yes, you\u2019re correct. \nI wouldn\u2019t call it child porn and it doesn\u2019t fit the definition of cp neither legally or morally\u2026 But I\u2019m also not someone in a position to bring charges against someone who I suspect shot footage of naked children on behalf of an insurance company. \nThey correctly mitigated risks and saw the optics of the situation before anything came of it",

            "It's not morally or legally child porn, but taking nude photos of somebody else's children without them knowing is just asking for trouble.",
            "Yeah no matter how you slice it, pornography or not, you\u2019re opening yourself up to a huge amount of liability by doing that. I\u2019m also very suspect of whoever insisted upon getting the pictures of the naked children for proof. Why? That seems\u2026very odd to say the least.",
            "Yeah, I know that it wouldn't actually be child porn, but I also know that I never want to have to convince a jury that the naked photos I have of children aren't actually child porn. \nSeemed much easier to just go home.",

            "A woman in my church went through a massive custody battle after a divorce. She tried to claim her husband had CP of their kids because some photo albums that left with him included some bathtime pictures. \nThis went nowhere legally speaking and didn't ultimately affect the final judgement iirc, but it led to massive drama and rumor mills in the church about the husband. \nFor the record, I no longer am religious.

They married. 4 kids later this happened:\nIn between the early 2000s and the guilty plea the sex offender registry was developed (it existed prior but only violent sex offenders had to be on it) and computerized. He was indeed convicted but failed to register. In the summer of 2001, after 15+ years of marriage the police came to arrest him for failure to register. He got 5 years for failure to register. \nHe was the sole provider as a welder. The wife went on welfare. \nThe state refused to be lenient on the punishment this time. Full 5 years.

Hypothetically speaking, if states were to follow suit, you could see something like, say, 2 months from now it's TX, AL, MS, LA, and SC, 6 months from now, UT, MO, ID, IA, SD, ND, NE, KS, OK, IN, NC, GA, ME, ID, AZ, AR, WV, AK, TN, KY, and OH are added with similar laws.",
            "This is honestly the only relevant angle at the moment",
            "My first thought as well.  Also a good argument for just not giving the state the power to put people to death.",
            "This needs to be at the top. The pointless conversation going on in this thread is exactly what Desantis wants, because it means people are buying into the justification for this law and not looking at what's actually going on.\nAnti-drag laws are passed, with wording vague enough to apply to anyone who is visibly trans or gender non-conforming. Violating this law is considered a sex crime, potentially against children. So, being transgender in public near a child is a sex crime against children. Then, shortly after, Florida passes more laws, making sex crimes against children punishable by death and making the death penalty no longer require a unanimous vote from the jury.\nFlorida Republicans have plausible deniability; after all, on its face, these are steps meant to \"protect children.\" It's harder to have sympathy for child predators, so if you take things at face value, you get this thread. I mean, sure, technically all of these laws together passed in quick succession by a man who openly hates queer people and wants us eradicated would hypothetically allow someone to be arrested, convicted, and executed for being trans, but that's totally not the point, right...?",
            "Right?? Unless I'm thinking of another law, the one OP asked about is just broadly sex crimes. While also labeling drag as a sex crime.\nFocusing solely on the child molester part of sex crimes here is a little fucking weird, ngl.",
            "Yeah. All the to comments are making legitimate points about preventing reporting or the perp straight up killing the kid, but the most important piece is the social context, which is somehow both obvious and totally lost on people. It takes the absolute smallest amount of critical thought to put that together, which honestly continues to make me feel we're fucked lol",
            "From a pragmatic, immediate standpoint, it would result in a lot more homicides. A dead victim can\u2019t talk. \nFrom the second, Florida\u2019s quite close to passing laws that would simply make existing publicly as a queer person fall under that sentence. It could easily open the way for genocide.",
            ">It could easily open the way for genocide.\nThat's the whole point. They can't make being gay or trans a death penalty, but they can make any sex crime against children a death penalty and then make being gay or trans or supporting your gay or trans child a \"sex crime against children.\" Same desired result without openly issuing a genocidal Nationalist Christian (Nat-C) fatwa.",
            "Yep my first thought was that they're gonna accuse random drag queens for just daring to exist",
            "This needs to be one of the top responses, they very deliberately have labeled all queer and trans people as Groomers which is then equating them to child molesters so the leap is not that fucking far to take.  \nThis is the justification theyre trying to use to create a genocide and cleanse this state of undesirables. Ron DeSantis is a fucking cancer on our nation.",
            "Exactly.\nLook at this recipe of subsequent laws\nDefine dressing/presenting as not your birth sex as drag.\nDefine being in drag around children as a sex crime against kids.\nAllow death penalty for sex crimes against kids\nAllow death penalty with a non-unanimous vote\nSo now, on paper, a trans person simply existing near a child would be a death-penalty-worth crime..",
            "Yep. And last month DeSantis signed a bill that makes it so only 8 jurors are required to force a death sentence (as opposed to unanimity, which was the existing law).\nPrepare for bills that do like you said, that criminalize existing as trans or gender non-conforming in public, and bills that classify that as (or equate it with) child sexual assault\nThey're gearing up for genocide, or at least to make deadly examples of certain people. Criminalize a people, increase potential punishment, and make implementing that punishment easier",
            "I am against the death penalty. Period. End of.",
            "I agree.  I understand a desire for vengeance.  I also understand that the enormity of such crimes seems a person unworthy of ever being free.  But the fact that even one person has been on Death Row and then exonerated proves the system is not infallible and without an infallible system, there is no place for the death penalty.",
            "I disagree, because Florida's idea of a child molester is a drag queen, and not the people actually fucking children.",
            "They will kill a drag queen but let Matt Gaetz exist.",
            "I disagree with state sponsored executions.",
            "I dont trust anything coming out of florida. They use the terms groomer and pedophile way too loosely to be able to accurately judge whether someone is a child molester.",
            "Yeah i dread hearing this used against a trans woman who used the bathroom at the same time as a child. I really don't trust Florida's government to determine who deserves to be labeled a predator, let alone who should die",
            "Yes, that's exactly what they are pretending to do. They'll kill innocent gay people because for them they are all pedophiles and \"groomers\". So yeah, they just want a legal way to kill based on homophobia.",
            "The death penalty is pointless, no matter the crime. It's never an effective enough deterrent, always costs taxpayer money that could've been spent on something else more useful in the long term, and people will always commit crimes without any regard to their consequences.\nInstead of a death penalty, how about we figure out what caused them to commit the problem in the first place? Instead of using lazy punishment methods to answer problems, we should be focusing more on evolving our ways of solving and preventing problems before they happen.",
            "We all know that it goes far beyond actual CM\u2019s. They really mean drag queens and trans people (who of course aren\u2019t the so called monsters these morons think they are)",
            "Fucking thank you.  \nThere's a reason they've put so much effort weaponizing language to make people associate queer folk with sex criminals.",
            "or just really anyone they don't like or approve of.  DeSantis is literally a Hitler wanna-be, if he is allowed to gain power we WILL become a fascist theocracy and American will be in for a long dark age",
            "Considering Florida just spent the last year calling members of the LGBT community child molesters, absolutely not. \nIt\u2019s extremely clear what their intentions are.\nThat\u2019s not even considering the fact that just because you think someone should die for an act, doesn\u2019t mean we should give the government the power to enact that death.\nOthers have brought up the fact that this will also make it more likely for relatives not to be reported, while making strangers more likely to kill their victim.",
            "I agree a child molester deserves to die, but I'm against the death penalty because the system isn't good enough to not kill innocent people.  Look up \"The Innocence Project\" to see many instances of people being freed from death row by DNA evidence.",
            "I do not understand how a \"small government conservative\" can ever think it is acceptable for the government to kill somebody.",
            "It all seems so noble... until they start classifying existing as an LGBTQ+ person in front of a minor as child molestation, or parents being supportive of their child's transition. Actual child molesters, convicted in a court of law- do with what you will. But I don't trust DeSantis, and I've got a bad feeling about this.",
            "There is no \"until\" here, that is literally the motivation for the law. Simply existing in a public toilet is now a sex crime if you are a gender nonconforming person. The whole point is to threaten people they don't like with the death penalty for existing in public. Soon enough I'm sure they will even do away with the \"in public\" part.",
            "Plus it's no longer necessary to have an unanimous decision by the jury to pass a death sentence in Florida. The purpose of this law is not to protect the children, it's about killing people that don't conform with the government's ideology.",
            "I was coming here to make this exact point.\nThe trajectory of the extremist right for the last several years has been to slowly, loudly, and broadly spread the 'othering' of specific groups while at the same time spreading the idea that it's morally acceptable to either judicially or extrajudicially execute child molesters and child rapists..\nAnd then, as we've seen more recently, the tying of those two ideas...\nThat LGBTQIA+ people and allies are predators on children, and that predators require execution...\nIt's been a very calculated move....\nJust ride down the road, especially in the rural south, and see how many pickup trucks have those 'shoot your local child predator' or similar bumper stickers.....\nThese are people that will not be willfully making any distinction whatsoever when it comes to the propaganda that they've been fed about the 'othered' groups....\nAnd it's those sorts of people who will also be on juries....",
            "What made the Nazis so utterly monstrous wasn\u2019t their capacity for depraved violence, but their ability to guide and encourage an entire populace to willingly participate in the killings, one step at a time.",
            "Yeah they are already turning parents that support their child\u2019s transition into criminals in the eyes of the state. With as much as they are leaning into the \u201call LGBTQ+ people are pedophiles\u201d rhetoric, it\u2019s not a far jump for them to make.",
            "Yep, they're just going to try to define gender affirming care as sexual battery.. So parents of trans kids can be put to death. They'll say hormones injure the sexual organs of the child. I can already see it coming... \n>The bill (Chapter 2023-25, L.O.F.) amends s. 794.011, F.S., to authorize a sentence of death for capital sexual battery offenses. Capital sexual battery occurs when an adult commits sexual battery upon a child less than twelve years of age, or who in an attempt to commit the sexual battery injures the sexual organs of the child. Sexual battery upon a child less than twelve years of age, or attempted sexual battery which causes injury to the sexual organs of the child, committed by a person who is in a position of familial or custodial authority is also a capital offense.",
            "Yep. The fact that this is happening in Florida is... sus.",
            "It\u2019s not sus at all. They are 100% transparent on what they want. It\u2019s not a coincidence they started pushing the following three laws recently-\n\n\nMake being in drag a sex crime\n\n\nMake sex crime punishable by death\n\n\nRemove unanimous verdicts as a requirement for the death penalty\n\n\nThe Floridian government wants the wholesale genocide of LGBTQ people. They just can\u2019t go shouting the word \u201cgenocide\u201d yet.",
            "Yes, genocide is a bad word, everyone knows that.\nThat's why it's called \"Removing/Eliminating the sickness of wokeism from the american populace\" or \"Restoring important values\" and \"Saving children from being threatened by ideological manipulation\"\nIt's also kinda weird to see this exact question on this issue for like a third time within two weeks. Even more Interesting how that part about LGBTQ people is never mentioned. I feel like someone is trying to manufacture approval, or at least distract from the issue this law brings, because everyone hates child molesters, but not everyone of the same people hate the LGBTQ",
            "Republicans: we want to eradicate transgender people\nEveryone else: Hmm but what does it mean?\nwww.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924",

            "Florida is absolutely going to use this to kill trans and other LGBTQ people",
            "Exactly this. While there's a healthy debate in the comments here about the merits of the death penalty for child molesters, but given the current political climate in Florida, it's painfully clear that the government there has no interest in protecting children and would definitely use this law to eliminate their political enemies by labeling anyone they don't like as child molesters and executing them. Fascism isn't coming to America, it's already taken hold so much so that they don't have to hide anymore.",
            "I disagree with the death penalty on principle, but especially for non-murder offenses. Remember the Satanic Panic when kids were talked into making all kinds of false allegations that law enforcement took as true? That could easily happen here. Also, I used to work in family court and it's shocking the number of times a parent makes or has the kid make a false outcry to try to get custody (usually it's the mom, but I've seen dads do it to mom's new boyfriend/husband too).\nFinally, there's the chilling effect this would have on real outcries. Kids are already hesitant to report abuse by a parent or trusted adult. This just gives the offender another thing they can use to keep kids quiet - \"remember, you can't tell anybody about this or they could kill me. You wouldn't want that, would you?\""

Others consider patches with archon quest as non-filler patches while the rest are filler, and so on.

That is my main reason of doubt in pulling for him, and if any other unit would be a better choice over him?",
            "venti provides unparalleled grouping, kazuha provides a powerful buff and some level of crowd-control too. for most things we get in the abyss these days kazuha is a straight upgrade (maybe not next rotation based on the leaks though) because you don't get super good mileage from venti's black hole.",

            "General thoughts on the Fatui, Harbingers, and the Tsaritsa, probably nothing directly spoilery so I'm not tagging (bc I'm lazy), but does feature some bold predictions for the direction of the story that might come true in a monkeys banging on a typewriter twist of fate:\nI remember like a thread or two ago, someone said that the Tsarista we've heard so much about was actually going to be the Cryo Sovereign masquerading as the Cryo Archon (this was said to complain about the lack of evil playable characters in Genshin, IIRC, though this is not a callout against them).\nUnironically though, that actually has a rather strong narrative possibility tied to it that would genuinely work for the purpose of both redeeming the Harbingers and Fatui without necessarily turning them 'good' and for a bit of genuine strife amongst the Fatui and Snezhnaya as a whole.\nImagine, it comes to light that their beloved Archon is actually an impostor scheming to tear the world asunder and do whatever she's after (something apocalyptic, for the sake of this premise, we'll say turn Teyvat into a giant parking lot). And with it, the Fatui and the Harbingers are split down the middle. Some choose to side with the Tsaritsa, as she was still their leader and the one they've been following all this time, while others choose to side with the Traveler against the Tsaritsa.\nIt'd honestly be a cool premise for the AQ, and could be an excellent way to develop a good chunk of the Harbingers. Say, Pulcinella, Tartaglia, Pantalone, and Sandrone team up with the Traveler and have to actually work together with us because the Tsarista's plan is very much bad for them. They wouldn't necessarily be turned good, but they're on our side for now.\nMeanwhile Pierro, Dottore, Columbina, Capitano, and Arlecchino are with the Tsaritsa since their goals probably directly align with the Tsaritsa (Pierro), Tsarista's actions would be beneficial or at least interesting enough to see through (Dottore), out of loyalty (Capitano), to get revenge on the Traveler for Signora (Arlecchino), or because ??? (Columbina, she's a wild card when it comes to Fatui theorizing).\nThis would cause a genuine civil war in Snezhnaya, and we could see a lot of interesting stuff out of it. Like, we could have a good chunk of the arc literally just be our heroes avoiding the Tsarista's Harbingers because we've got the weaker ones while they've got literally all of their near-godly strong fighters, culminating in Tartaglia 'sacrificing' himself to fend off Capitano so we can get to the Tsarista, stop her, and bring back the previous Cryo Archon (who I guess is just like vibing in a block of ice or something). Tartaglia probably wouldn't die for real, they'd probably just have Capitano beat him without killing him or even just be stalled long enough that Traveler beats the Tsarista and Capitano just calls it quits there, but it'd be a cool scene anyway.\nThis idea is probably half-baked, but honestly I do think there's genuine narrative potential hidden in this idea that came about from a random thread-goer's complaining.",
            "I personally prefer this than how they play Raiden as \"evil\", but the child in me still want \"Natlan vs Snezhnaya all-out war\" narrative",

Actual quote from the quest: >!\"Yes, in the end, all of us shall face a common enemy and the inescapable long night... Everyone in Snezhnaya has been thusly warned. So, every drop of tears and blood of mankind, shed for the sake of this cruel world... They shall not be shed in vain.\"!<)\nThis is actually how I think they can get the rest of the Harbingers playable without having them turn against the Tsaritsa (or to have the Tsaritsa herself need to be \"secretly\" good, we already know from Wanderer's voicelines that she's pretty beloved and kind though he still doesn't trust her) or anything. I imagine we won't be able to stop them from accomplishing this plan otherwise it'd be a pretty disappointing ending to the Teyvat chapter as a whole, but the playable characters just have to be on amicable enough terms to talk to us to actually be playable.

If it doesn't have a saved video of you walking up to it and then the footage cutting then they can't argue it didn't just have a technical issue vs. you unplugging it.\nObviously you shouldn't have to do either of these but it is more about avoiding the charge from airbnb.

In fact I have had a friend on vacation once stumble into the bathroom and break a glass shower door and despite us trying to pay for damages the hotel said they have that covered by insurance so it\u2019s no worry to us.\nIn an AirBnB if you don\u2019t take out the trash can in one of the bathrooms you\u2019re getting hit with a $300 cleaning fee. \nAnd somehow an AirBnB is now more expensive per night than a hotel room even if you ignore the fees.

Some 'investor' came along and said: \"you know what, I wonder if there is a way I could inject myself into the middle of that and get paid just to match people?\"  Then they sank literally billions of dollars to build the gig economy and ran it at a massive loss to ensure it would be cheap.  Because who the hell would pay hotel rates to stay at a strangers house??  Who in their right mind is going to get into some strangers car and trust that they won't get raped??  Cheap people that's who.  Now they are trying to turn a profit and the cost of everything is sky rocketing back to where they should be for providing those services.",
            "There was a precursor to Airbnb and that was Couch Surfing. It grew a community of strangers inviting strangers into their home offering a more local experience. You'd sleep on their couch/spare bed if they had one. Of course you'd be offered all their amenities. It was also an offer for those who weren't just looking for package/beach holidays but, more of an \"authentic\" local experience. The idea that you could really experience what it's like living in another country. It was the travelling backpackers dream in 1 website. Cheap place to sleep, do laundry, meet/hang out with locals etc.\nAirbnb was similar to this at the start. It had people just renting out an extra room. I got to meet some cool people swapping stories. Then this group splintered as not everyone both (host/renter) sides didn't really want much contact. Which is fine but this group of no contact hosts set a certain expections that basically drove away people who just wanted to rent a spare room and meet new people away from airbnb. I stayed with a host a few times and started to become friends with them over 3 trips. On the 4th trip was looking forward to staying with them again to see they had removed their home off the platform. I sent them a message on FB about it. They told me how they had a few nightmare experiences and didn't want to deal with people who were treating them like a hotel. I was sad by that but it was cool to be able to have dinner with them again when I did visit the area.\nThis no contact group then split further into people who'd rent out whole apartments/holiday homes. That's when the cottage industry formed around airbnb. People learned they could make more than being a landlord. x10 to x100 times the monthly rent of the area with no downside of being a landlord. Airbnb will back you up because they need to keep your property on the app. There's even a cottage industry of management companies for airbnb hosts. They take % of earnings and handle bookings, cleanings and advertising. They'll promise hosts $xx,xxx garunteed yearly income and all they hand over their keys to the office.",

In my later years around 2015, I became heavily transphobic, falling into the hole of \"trans people are mentally ill\", and \"trans people are just doing it for attention\". Oops. Guess what. I've been transitioning for 6 years now, medically for 5.\nThe projection is real. It's not all of us,it does shift the blame, and it even gets weaponized as a means to shame gay and trans people, even by \"allies\", but it is very real.",
            "It's weird how some trans people have been stamping their feet since age 3 and insisting \"I'm not a boy, I'm a girl, I don't want a haircut,\" etc., or \"I'm not a girl, I'm a boy, I don't want to wear a dress,\" and consistently know and tell everyone who they really are into adulthood, and then there are stories like this. Were you totally oblivious to it, or were you sort of aware you were suppressing something?\nDo you think it's more accurate to say you were always really female, and that your body didn't outwardly reflect it and you didn't realize the truth until later, or that you used to be male, and that you transitioned to female? Because I think a lot of people think of it the latter way, but I don't know how many trans people do. Terms like MTF and FTM suggest the latter.\nI also think it's interesting that about 1 in 50 people, which would mean multiple people in each school, are intersex, meaning their genitals and internal sex organs aren't entirely or exclusively one sex or another, or their chromosomes or hormones don't match the common sexual expression for their genitals and sex organs. Because these various forms of intersexuality provide clear evidence that other people can see that genitals aren't the be-all and end-all of someone's gender. So maybe we should just listen to people when they tell us who they are.",
            "I was suppressing.\nMy gender dysphoria kicked into full gear when I was 10 years old. It started with a game of pretend with my cousin where we were pretending to transform into animals. It was a hot August night in 1995, I couldn't sleep, so I started thinking about the game and what it would be like to actually be an animal. But then a single question entered my head; \"What if I transformed into a girl?\" That's when my gender dysphoria kicked in and I started struggling with my body and identity. I became transphobic because I was trying to suppress my thoughts and feelings. \"Toxic masculinity\" was my way to try to prove to myself that I was \"a man\" because things like karate, boxing, fishing, hunting, camping, shooting, etc didn't work to \"fix\" me.\nAnd even then, I still remember plenty of things when I was little that were huge early signs. Like fighting with my parents after my sister gave me a makeover. I was 6 or 7 when it happened. My sister gave me a makeover, my dad didn't like what she did, and he demanded that I took it off. I didn't want to. It made me feel happy. But we fought and he hit me. Then another time, I became extremely jealous of my friend's Easter dress. And, just so much stuff where I wished I could do girl things, or I wished I could be a girl, but I just didn't have that existential crisis where I was questioning my identity, you know?",

My mom would entertain it all for a little bit, but then tell me no, probably after a discussion with dad. (Although I stopped asking for makeup when someone at school noticed and made fun of me.) I wonder if anything would be different today if no one teased me or said no. I don't have any question about being male, and I've had long-term roommates who were surprised when I told them I was gay, but I wonder if maybe I would be more feminine if I had been allowed to play with all the fun feminine things I wanted as a kid.",

            "\"doomguy is very squishy\" He went through 2016 and Eternal without a single scratch lore accurately only because the Praetor suit makes him invincible (plus he literally put himself inside a cannon and blasted a metal wall without caring nor hesitating much). Doomguy doesn't only use his guns, he's hella strong too, devs were asked how strong he was and they simply said that he could fight a titan bare-handed but he doesn't think it would be fun, the only reason why he uses guns is because is for \"fun\" (the red bonus who allows you to one-shot demons with your hands is actually what Doomguy would look like when getting serious). If he can beat Dante or not? I don't know to be honest, Doomguy is an immovable object and Dante is an unstoppable force, it's a fight that might last billions of years, or it would stop after 5 minutes because they'd have something better to do",

That's why he can die or have an arm ripped off by them. Argent powered attacks can kill him so because dante is a demon he would be able to hurt him just normally. Yeah \"fun\" but he couldn't do it without guns. His hands were weak in literally every doom game that was out.",

            "The Testament is not clear enough, and all it ever says is that he killed a few Titans without weapons, which sounds powerful and all until you realize that Dante can do the same thing with Savior, and Savior is just a buffed up version of Icon of Sin.\nDoomguy gets sealed when the demons dropped a church on him. And later in the 2016 game he also can be somewhat controlled by Doctor Hayden's machine, and got the crucible blade stolen from him.\nSo far, no one in the game can control or hold off Dante, maybe Nero but that is a different story because of his Devil Bringer arm. No buildings can be dropped on top of him because of Quicksilver (which slows done time itself, something that doom guy never has), and he also has a ton of other abilities that doomguy doesn't have.\nDoppelganger, Trickster, and he can use any weapon to its full effectiveness by just getting it, he has every thing that doom guy has except BFG (which can be compensated with other skills), Royal Guard can tank Savior's laser as shown in the DMC4 novel, and not to mention he has far more diverse set of weapons than Doomguy. He also scales equal with Vergil, which is another feat of itself.\nMan frequently tank hits from Vergil who can cut through Space-Time, and his speed while slightly slower than Vergil who is almost as fast as light, still fast enough to keep up with him. Doom guy will get speedblitz'ed by even Nero should he try to fight Sparda's offsprings. Doomguy can't even double jump or air dash without power armour, something that Nero and Dante can do naturally and Vergil compensates for with Trick Up and Trick Down.\nAnd finally, Doom Guy's best feat is killing Davoth, who's power on a scale wise is far weaker than Mundus that can directly manipulate reality itself. Davoth can do this to an extent, but he only teleports the slayer with him during the duel, while Mundus creates another god damned dimension. While you can argue that Dante couldn't kill Mundus, he still beats him in a fight and sealed him away like Sparda did.\nOh yeah, did I mention Sin DT? He can create black holes, do near instant teleportation, fire off blue colored fireballs that are slightly less hotter than the surface of the sun, and then there's Devil Sword Dante. Doomguy has no such abilities, and I don't think he can survive a black hole either. Besides that, he needs to physically absorb power from other demons to regenerate his injuries, while Dante only has to activate DT.\nDante is far stronger than you think based on feats and concrete evidence alone. Tell me, what is Doomguy's power besides the game jerking him off?",

Some incantation tablets, and an ancient combat suit which was given a name: the 'Praetor Suit'. When found, it was encased in an inscribed stone tomb. The suit was extracted from the rock, cleaned, and subjected to numerous tolerance tests, and found to be almost impervious to any damage. It appeared to have some mechanical function as well - small receptors on the gloves and chest plate that attracted Argent plasma and dissipated it through capillary tubes in the substructure. Markings on the armor were also consistent with images of a man (or humanoid) seen in several tablets and stones found on other expeditions. The same markings were also noted on the Helix Stone.\nDespite it being clear that the suit can be activated in some way, no method has been found to do it. It appears to be missing a component, likely the Doom Marine himself.",

I just found out yesterday that my colleague (same position as me) receives a compensation that\u2019s 10K more than mine.\n\nFor context, i am a new hire (2 months in) and yung colleague ko is mag 1 month pa lang. She\u2019s 3 years older than me and we have a salary difference of 10K. Same lang kami ng position.\n\nYesterday, nag leave kasi siya and nagstay muna ako sa area nya para makipagchikahan with our other teammates. Surprisingly, naka expose sa desk niya yung contract and JO niya and tbh, hindi ko naiwasang hindi mag peek. Then ayun, nakita ko yung offer sakanya. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to feel, if that\u2019s unfair na mas malaki sahod niya by 10K pero iniisip ko kasi baka naman bigger offer sakanya dahil she\u2019s older. Idk. Medyo frustrated lang ako now na ganun. \n\nPlease, I need your insights on this. Also, if ma-regular man ako, I\u2019m not sure if yung increase ko aabot ng 10K. Thank you :&lt;",

            "You should have asked for a higher salary during salary negotiation. Not your colleague\u2019s fault for knowing her worth.",
            "True.\nMadalas hanggat kaya ng company ilolow ball k tlga.",
            "This. \u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf",
            "Might also be because colleague was already earning more than you did before you both got hired. Doesn't make sense for her to take a pay cut or for the company to offer her a very small increase.",
            "Offers for a specific position comes in ranges. Di  kayo lahat in a same position same ng sahod. Depende na lang on what you can offer sa company if fit sa budget nila and sa negotiation skills mo during the hiring process.\nIf you feel na you deserve higher pay, you can talk to your manager after some time. Raise your achievements or if you have consistently exceeded some metrics/KPIs sa work mo. It\u2019s ok to negotiate if you feel na you are underpaid.",
            "You mentioned na she\u2019s 3 years older than you. Ofcourse, compensation depends on what you can offer sa company regardless if same position. Her work experience deserves a premium too. Besides, aside from the actual work expected from you, baka may mga bagay na pwede niya ma contribute na di mo kayang ibigay kasi fresh grad ka plg. \nIf you were in her shoes, wouldn\u2019t you think your previous work experience relevant to your current role deserves a premium too?",
            "It depends, do you think much skilled ka sa kanya? If so, then raise a voice and prove it. Life isn't exactly the same as Quests in Games that have a fixed amount of gold coins you receive at the end of each quest no matter each time, life is more skill based.\nI'm not exactly defending the other person in question, but has it ever crossed your mind that she might be more skilled than you, has the same position but more responsibilities, has the same position but has more experience than you consider the person is older and you're clearly a fresh graduate? There are a lot of questions that come into play, not just because the other person IS OLDER.",
            "Most companies pay a premium to attract experienced talent. The higher pay is not because your colleague is older, but likely because she has previous relevant experience to offer. Why do you think people move to a different company even if it\u2019s for the same role? Even if this were not the case and this was your colleague\u2019s first job, maybe your colleague was smart enough to negotiate their salary. Another possibility is your company could have been pressed for staffing, and needed to fill position/s ASAP, so willing to offer more to hire immediately.",

            "I had a similar experience before, baka makatulong.\nMay junior ako na naging kaibigan ko sa work, same age kami mas matagal lang ako ng onti sa company. Nalaman ko na mas mataas yung salary niya by about 50% compared sa salary ko. Nagulat at nagtaka ako kung bakit ang laki ng difference, kung pantay kami or mas mataas lang siya ng onti okay pa sakin eh, pero 50% higher? damn HAHAHA. So I asked him, pano naging ganun salary niya, sabi niya nung pagpasok niya pa lang sa company nag negotiate na siya for a higher offer, tapos tuwing yearly appraisal namin nag nenego din siya for an additional increase kahit onti lang. Compared sakin na tinatanggap ko lang agad yung offer na binibigay ng company.\nNafrustrate din ako, I felt underappreciated, pero I never felt anything bad towards my junior. Thankful pa nga ako na nagtiwala siya sakin and shinare niya yun kasi at least alam ko na pwde pala yung ganung salary and kailangan ko din pala talaga magnego plus I felt na he deserved it because he asked for it.\nAfter that naisip ko na kailangan ko din magpaincrease. Nag-ipon ako ng bala, ginalingan ko sa work, nagresearch ako kung ano ba yung tamang salary, magkano ba inoofer ng ibang companies for the same position and experience, then I told my manager na I want to setup a meeting for a salary increase negotation. Pero nagkataon mapopromote na din pala ako so sabi ng manager ko isabay ko na lang yun sa meeting namin kapag ipopromote na ako.\nFast forward nung napromote ako, binigyan ako ng offer na para sakin okay naman na pero I still decided to negotiate and ask for more. Thankfully, ready yung mga bala ko kaya inapprove din ng company yung hiningi kong additional increase. Yung naging salary ko after that is higher na than my junior and halos na double yung salary ko compared to my previous one.\nAng tip ko ibahin mo lang mindset mo. Wag kang maingit, wag ka mag compare. Instead look at it as \"ahhh, pwde pala yung ganung salary. Gagalingan ko, aayusin ko para pwde ako makipag negotiate for a higher salary\". Wag kang mahiya humingi ng additional increase if alam mo namang ginawa mo yung trabaho mo and more.\nP.S. Using a throwaway account kasi nagrereddit din yung junior ko and baka andito siya. Kung mabasa mo man to Master, thank you dahil nagtiwala ka and nagshare ka ng info sakin. HAHAHAH may utang ako sayo, paglumabas ulit tayo libre ko na inuman natin.",
            "Welp this is precisely why \"salary\" is still a taboo topic in the workplace...",
            "True. Many would say na bakit hindi naka disclose or bakit confidential. Eto nagiging effect. Inggit, pagtataka, etc.\nSalary isn't even just based from age and tenure. Skills pa rin.\nNako, OP. That's something you shouldn't do to yourself--comparing yourself to others especially in a workplace.",
            "ganito ha WAG KA MAGTATANONG NG SAHOD NG IBA, confidential po iyan as per hr at iho ganito yan ha , sa pag aaply dapat marunong ka mag haggle during interview. sample any position sa company may salary range nagkataon  siguro nahaggle nya yung max sa position at ikaw naman min siguro nung interview nag offer sa iyo mababa tapos patol ka naman agad wala tanong tanong wala hirit, know your worth.",
            "Better negotiator yung new hire. It's not on them na mababa ang sahod mo. You should've demanded more kung naliliitan ka. It's on you.",

            "A 10k gap may be challenging to chase sa current company mo. You need solid results to defend it and a  great relationship with your leaders and peers. Stay for a year or 2 then job hop na. You can target 25\u201040% increase depende kung gaano ka indemand ng role sa job hopping. Pagnagstay ka, most MNCs ay nasa range ng 5-12% ang annual salary increase. Maximize ang pwede mo lagi mapiga sa negotiation phase.",
            "Companies usually have salary bands. This band shows that salary range for each role or job level. \nExample: Both of you are accounting associates. An accounting associate position will have a salary band of 25k (low) - 30k (mid) - 35k (high). When you go through an interview process, the result of that is endorsed to the comp & ben team or person in the company who then determines which compensation within the range should be offered to the chosen candidate. How they determine this - they look at current compensation package, experience in the same role, if applicable they also consider certifications or licenses. Say a fresh grad gets hired for the role and offered 25k as starting salary. Then another person gets hired for same role but this person is a CPA and has 2 years experience in another company and offered 35k. Same role, different salaries offered within the same salary band.",
            "Imagine nung na-hire ka excited ka.. looking forward ka sa new job mo.. then for some reason, nalaman mo sahod ng colleague mo: frustrated ka na.. kaya tama sila don't compare urself to others, wala kasalanan ang colleague mo dahil sa ikaw naman ang nakipag negotiate ng salary. Advice ko sayo? Wag mo itatanong ang sahod ng katrabaho mo kung hindi ka ready tanggapin na mas mataas sahod nya sayo.",
            "This is pretty self explanatory, madaming factor bakit mas malaki sahod niya sayo di lang dahil she\u2019s older than you tsaka it\u2019s normal na iba iba kayo ng sahod kahit na same position.",
            ">For context, i am a new hire\nMerong experience ang colleague mo kaya mag mataas ang sweldo nya.\nIf gusto mo ng mas mataas na sweldo, mag stay ka muna ng 1 year then mag hanap ka ng new company. For sure, tataas ang sweldo mo.",
            ">I need your insights on this. Also, if ma-regular man ako, I\u2019m not sure if yung increase ko aabot ng 10K.\nNo, unfornately. Not unless naka lagay sa contact mo na may increase ka upon regularization.",

I learned later on that I have PCOS, so that's why I smelled funky then. At least daijoubu naman ako. \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d \nAnyhow, IDK why I tolerated it. Pero nung nagwwork na ko, I started blocking them. I don't want to bother anyone with my troubles and whatever else. I also don't want to compare myself to them anymore. I'm not them and they're not me. Ok na ko with what I have. And for the record, wala na kong funky odors since I started meds for my PCOS. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Issue?!",

            "Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they go after them directly shortly. I feel like Nintendo will see their attempt to publish as an active threat somehow and decide now is the time to teach them a lesson for trying.\nObviously I'm speculating but Nintendo is aggressively petty, and overstepping at all with them is enough for them to try to shut you down.",
            "They won't. Nintendo hasn't bothered Yuzu or Ryujinx which let you emulate a current system so I don't see them going after Dolphin. This is all about trying to keep an emulator off of a popular storefront.",
            "Those systems very notoriously require you to dump the keys from a real console before use, which they're claiming Dolphin doesn't.\nNot saying they're right but that seems to be the basis.",
            "You can download those keys just as easily as those emulators.",
            "Yeah, it's just an extra step for the developers to protect themselves, but in reality, it's not a barrier for would-be pirates.",
            "You can, but from a legal standpoint, the emulator developer themselves aren't the one suppling those keys so from a certain point of view, they didn't break any copyright laws.",
            "From the point of view of the law, they didn't break any laws.",

            "I think what a lot of people don't understand is that it often doesn't matter if they broke any laws or not. Nintendo can send a frivolous cease and desist letter whenever they want, and they can sue whenever they want. They don't have to win the suit, they just have to outlast their opponent by prolonging the case and, by extension, the legal fees their opponent is forced to pay to defend themselves, until the opponent backs out. It's a classic case of the Chilling Effect.",
            "That has no bearing on the legality of emulators",
            "It doesn't, but it does affect how much Nintendo cares. If you need to dump the keys, that means you need to buy a switch console from them, so they aren't really losing any sales.\nContrast that to something like Dolphin, which you can run without having a real console. Nintendo sees this as lost profit and therefore cares more.\nTo further prove the point, Nintendo absolutely does viciously hunt down anyone who publishes the keys online (which allows Switch emulation without having a real console), and they usually get taken down in days if not hours.",

Thus, use of the Dolphin emulator unlawfully 'circumvent[s] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under' the Copyright Act.\"\nNo. The cease and desist clearly targets Dolphin. Despite owning a console, Nintendo is claiming (imo falsely) that using the decryption keys from the system to decode the rom is illegal in the emulator.",
            "That's a little worrying considering that the new Zelda was just popularly emulated. Wonder if Nintendo is doing this with the hopes of starting a lawsuit and setting a new precedent, ultimately outlawing emulation. A bunch of 3DS exploits that have been around for about a decade were just recently patched as well",
            "There already is precedent against banning Emulation in the US.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp.\nThey can sue literally whenever they want but the Supreme Court has been surprisingly lax on tech and internet related lawsuits, refusing to even see them",
            "Finally, someone says it. Nintendo isn't going after the emulators because there is already a legal precedent. Emulators aren't going anywhere.",
            "That's only binding within the 9th Circuit. If Nintendo wanted to push it, they would sue a dev from outside the west coast and re litigate it.",

I don't see how it could be illegal to make something that's able to play the ROMs of the games.  Where I would think the legal issues come in is in the acquisition of the games themselves.",
            "This was the case on older emulators that were simply running a ROM ripped from a game, but as games got more complicated the lines got blurrier. Depending on how you achieve it, some emulators require system software that is copyrighted, such as BIOS or OS.\nI haven't used Dolphin and I'm sure they're careful if they've been at it this long, but I've run into that in the past on others.",

            "A combination of both.\nThe wii's hardware is very similar to the GameCube's so combining effort was relatively easy. In comparison, the PS2 had a very strange design with enormous fillrate (comparable to modern GPUs) but no programmable shading, and the PS3 also had a strange architecture arguably more suited for supercomputers than for gaming.\nXbox was close enough to normal PCs that a lot of effort was spent on trying to use translation layers rather than traditional emulation, but that ended up not working well enough. Also, most of its games had a PC release or run on the later consoles, both of which sapped a lot of motivation in building an open source emulator.\nThat being said, the Dolphin team has done amazing work. The other emulators had problems that Dolphin didn't have to deal with, but Dolphin had lots of its own problems and they solved them very well.",
            ">the PS3 also had a strange architecture arguably more suited for supercomputers than for gaming.\nLol because it had a glorious ppc IBM cpu. And funnily enough people did use them as super computers, most notably the US Air force who had like 1,500 (going off memory here) ps3's connected together to analyze satellite images and was in the top 50 supercomputers at the time.",
            "It was closer to 2000, all the older ones that were able to run Linux even, iirc. Article here.",
            "This was in part due to the fact that the PS3 was sold at a relative loss that was expected to be made up for by associated game sales, so it had very good hardware for its price point.",
            "What's fillrate?",
            "Demand and Nintendos dedication to minimum minus design (do the bare minimum, then spend tons of money somehow lowering the bar even further).\nGamecube, Wii, and Wiiu are essentially the same hardware. The only difference is clock speed, number of cores, and amount of memory.  There is no better value in contributing to an emulator than Dolphin, if you want your contributions to have impact.  3 whole console generations all in one software package.\nDemand is from the fact that there is no way to play nintendo games except on Nintendo hardware.  You dont see Xbox(360) emulation at this level because most of the xbox games anyone ever cared about were on other platforms and readily available.\nNintendo, since the day they stopped making pornography and started making childrens electronics, have had a focus on raping and pillaging anyone dumb enough to do business with them. They have a legendary reputation of annihilating and sabotaging third party developers through legal manipulation and staggering amounts of money.  Nintendo has a powerful, ruthless and effective legal department that almost certainly is paid more than the actual game developers and they are more the proponents of a \"walled garden\" design than even apple. Nintendo loathes the idea of someone keeping old consoles and playing old games, they want to have 100% control of the products forever so they can sell you only whats profitable to them at the moment. \nThey have also gone after used game sales in the past but they were not very successful. Nintendo DOES NOT want you to keep your old consoles, and to them everyone who owns Wii or Super Nintendo today is a personal affront. They even went so far as to go after Twitch and other streaming services back in the day, and for awhile it was kind of iffy whether you should stream Nintendo games because you might just get a lawsuit for it, even if it was speedruns of some ancient forgotten NES game. \nNintendo is BY FAR the most anti consumer company in the entire industry, and I cant honestly think of another company on their level.",

Those lawsuits have long been used as a precedent to uphold emulation as legal in the United States, but it's a complex topic, and Nintendo's case here would likely be argued on different legal grounds.\nThen again idk how Dolphin works. But either way if dolphin did decide to counter it could be REALLY food or REALLY bad. (Again from article)\n>The question is whether Nintendo would truly pursue legal action in this case\u2014and if it did, what would happen. A ruling in either direction would have far-reaching implications for emulation, as most if not all emulators of modern game systems could likely be held in violation of the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions if Nintendo were to win the case.

They're probably planning to release a Super-Duper Premium tier for their garbage online service that will have 5 Gamecube games on it and are big mad that Dolphin will let people play these games for free. Emulators are completely legal, so they can't go after the actual emulator, just the release on Steam. Hilarious since RetroArch is also on Steam and lets you emulate several Nintendo consoles.\nNintendo throwing their weight around, trying to intimidate everyone around them will only get them so far, and I hope Valve and the Dolphin team fight back like Console Classix did back in the day. Like with the Console Classix rom-renting service, Nintendo has no legal ground to stand on here. They're just throwing this shit out hoping that the team is too afraid to go up against them and backs off. I've been spreading this video around a lot recently with friends since TOTK leaked online, and I feel its important to remind people that emulators are 100% legal so long as they don't use any copyrighted code, and provide these companies with genuine competition, which a lot of people seem to ignore when this topic is brought up.",

            "You'd have to look deeper, they're going with the 'circumvention of copy protection' as the reason for the takedown, which is at least more legitimate than 'contains copyright material'..\nThe problem as I see it (and I've not read the DMCA on this, so pinch of salt and assumptions abound), is that if you have a decryption key, and a ROM that requires it, a general user isn't able to do much with those pieces of data, but as soon as you write some code which can take a key and decrypt a ROM, then you MAY fall into that space of circumvention.\nDolphin doesn't need the key, or the ROM itself (both of them would, as you correctly mention, fall under general copyright), but the shim that puts the two together and makes the encrypted ROM data readable is something which I don't believe has been challenged in court to this point, which makes it difficult to know whether Nintendo are playing fast and loose with the DMCA.\nThe only thing that kinda boggles my mind, was that Nintendo have seemingly been indicating that the code DOESN'T violate the DMCA (otherwise they'd have taken Dolphin down in it's entirety before now), but it's only suddenly an issue because they were intending on publishing on steam.",
            "Likely they don't want the publicity that Dolphin could get by going up on Steam.\nNot that it wouldn't be drowned immediately on the ratings by a thousand-thousand hentai games.",
            "That's certainly possible, but at the same time, if Nintendo truly believed that Dolphin is violating the DMCA, they could send exactly the same takedown notice to GitHub and have the source repository, and thus pretty much the entire project, shut down.\nIt kinda gives the impression that Nintendo aren't actually confident about winning this battle in court, so they're not going after the project directly to avoid that confrontation, but preventing publishing on Steam (and thus spread) is something that's unlikely to be contested.\nAgain, just my 2c",
            "Nintendon't strikes again.",
            "Idiots. Everything they do is to work against game preservation. They literally dont have the legal right to do this at all. Hoping the Dolphin devs challenge them. Fuck Nintendo.",

The fact i can take my Steam library everywhere on the Deck and not have to pay for the games I want to play on the go again showed me how greedy Nintendo is. For example, I still have Super Mario World on the SNES. Bought it digitally on the Wii, then they wanted me to pay another $1.50 for it on the Wii U... Nintendo makes great games that are usually well polished but they\u2019re so ancient when it comes to modern things like cloud saves, online play etc. Fuck Nintendo.

They were insecure, manipulative, abusive, and throughout the entire relationship, they made it seem like it's my fault that I am attractive and confident. They wanted me to be less, so they will feel bigger, better. I noticed it on both of them na when we're with other people and I'm getting compliments whether it's about my looks or my personality, they would always add backhanded compliments. Lowkey nangdo-down. They also both cheated on me cause that's how insecure they were.\nNow, I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life.

She was kind, confident, wild in the sack and very caring. Wifey material to be honest. The thing is, I was not able keep up with her luho and activities such as opera concerts and expensive dates in restaurants so when the pandemic hit, we went on our own seperate ways.

Somewhat grew into an affectionate relationship as she was getting out of her current relationship. When we first met, it dawned on me how there's this visible gap between us, pagdadamit palang. I took for granted un mga kinukwento nya over chat before we met about their societal status and her ancestry since I also knew people along those lines. Iba pla pag magiging partner mo na, like the world's standards and expectations just dawns on you. Her face resembled a celebrity, sobrang bubbly kasama, and dressed impecabbly well since she had gigs as a print model. I was your typical gloomy looking boy. I didn't have that bad of a self esteem back then pero  looking at us, personality and physical wise, i clearly was lucky. Didn't care though as long as I can make her smile. Also, Was still a college student back then, tag 100 laman nh wallet ko, while un sa kanya puro yellow and blue bills kaya madalas sya bayad ng date.

He writes the most beautiful letters and shares his daily reads and learnings sakin which i find very educational naman at naaappreciate ko din bilang hindi naman ako matalino din. It was very intimidating for someone like me na laking probinsya at galing sa isang simpleng pamilya. We had to cut communication kasi nahihirapan na din. He went abroad for his masters degree.

She already has a decent job, mataas para sa isang entry level engineer. Meron syang side hustle as an FA, and mataas kanyang mga commision. Insured narin sya (3 premiums) at lagi nyang binibida na beneficiary nya ako. At the same time her family just finished their new house. Di ko pala naikweto pero niregaluhan sya ng papa nya ng second hand car right after graduation. \nAlam ko naman dapat na di ko icompare ang sarili ko. In fact, i see her as an inspiration. During college days talagang ni lo-look up ko sya. Tinutuungan nya rin ako sa acads and i was realy grateful. Lagi sya nandyan to listen and comfort me  on my problems. Marunong syang makipag communicate, in fact she really understood me deeply. Yung tipong ang love language ko ay quality time pero toxic trait ko ay avoidance/ isolation. Nariyan sya willing to adjust.\nBiniro ko sya kung ano ba meron sakin at ako pinili nya. Alam ko naman na walang special sakin. Medyo gwapo hehe pero gago(bugoy), pilyo pero maginoo. Walang kwenta kausap laging pabiro. Nag eexercise paminsan minsan so medyo fit. Pero wala lang yun lahat sa kanya. Nagustuhan nya raw sakin is that kaya ko syang patawanin and that kaya ko rin syang ma outsmart yung tipong nakaka amaze daw kasi marami syang natututunan sakin. Pero higit sa lahat daw is the way I treat her. Yes, i treat her like a princess. Hindi lang princess, queen talaga. Yasss kweeeenn.\nPero hindi naman enough ang kilig at love sa isang relationship. Parang nag self pity ako. Ang layo na ng narating nya at ako naguumpisa palang. Plano ko ring pagawaan ng bahay mga magulang ko pero parang anlayo pa. Wala pa nga akong ipon samantalang sya insured na, earning her first 6 digit na savings. Gusto naman ako ng mga magulang nya, ako lang daw ang may kakayanang pakainin ng gulay ang kanila unica hija. Binibiro din ako ng tatay nya na sa kanilang firm magtrbaho. Sabi din naman ng gf ko that time, kung sakaling ikasal kami. Meron na kaming bahay. \nPero andami ko pang gustong gawin. Gusto ko mag grow on my own. Hindi ko kayang mapagsabay ang career, family, love. Gusto ko pang i figure out buhay ko. I cant do those things with her, kasi magiging dependent ako sa kanya. Ayoko rin naman magkaroon kami ng resentment in the long run.\nWe ended our 5 year relationship peacefully without any diatribes. Walang cheating, walang third party, merong mga away pero walang major fight. We were really emotionally compatible. Sadyang we have grown apart lang talaga. We loved each other deeply. I think we deserve a pat on the back. She is out of my league, and everyday in everyway im trying to improve myself. Hoping na someday kung baka sakali, we can be together again.",
            "Yes\u2026 financially-wise? Not sure if this will count pero it really felt na he\u2019s out of my league back then\u2026 This was 4 years ago, I was 19 and I dated a great guy \u2014 20 y/o. He made me feel loved, important and appreciated. Like okay naman yung whole relationship well there are certain bumps pero no biggie. Pero ayon, he comes from a well-off family \u2014 owns hotels and a lot of other huge businesses. My family was average and parang feel ko I couldn\u2019t keep up with his lifestyle. He had branded items, and idk for me that time I felt far from his lifestyle haha. I also started to think about the future din, meeting his parents (kasi nasa iloilo yung parents niya the whole time we were together) Ayon, I was so scared of what might happen sa future, na ang out of league talaga niya, so this was one of the reasons that led me to break it off with him\u2026 pinangunahan ako ng takot\nUp to this day, he\u2019s still my totga. I\u2019m 23 now, and I regret ending such beautiful thing. Ngayon ko lang din narealize na money don\u2019t matter much and that time, he really loved me\u2014 sobrang insecure ko lang talaga dati and traumatized from previous guy before this guy. And now he is with someone and they\u2019re happy together :( I\u2019m happy for him naman.  I learned to love myself na, and siguro the timing just wasn\u2019t right that time. Feel ko if ngayon kami nagmeet, we\u2019ll be able to make it. :( \nAyoooon, I\u2019m on my way to get my license to be an architect, and he\u2019s an engineer. \nPopoy at Basha yarn?!?! Joke, come back na sana siya sa akin huhu malay mo magkita kami sa isang project (sana single na siya char)",
            "Yes, OP pero hindi naging kami hahaha but we're friends naman. Tbh every time naririnig ko Afterglow ni Taylor Swift, siya naalala ko. Sino ba naman kasi ako, just a provincial girl tapos anak siya ng CEO. Matalino pa tsaka well-spoken haha.\nWell akala ko hanggang infatuation lang pero pinursue niya ako kaso pabebe ako (bc of my insecurities haha pero never ko sinabi sa kanya). 2019 to 2021, never naging kami officially haha pero naging special naman siya sakin. May iba na siya now, and I'm happy for him",
            "Wala, kasi pag alam ko na out of my league, di ko na iniisip na pwedeng maging kame. The other way around ang nangyayare pansin ko. Tipong i had an ex before and my friends say na di kami bagay na parang i deserve someone better. Mabait naman sya pero in terms of looks and the way he dresses dun nila na judge yung ex ko.\nAnd another scenario, my mom did not like my other ex boyfriend kesyo ganyan ganito i deserve someone better daw pero mahal ko eh. Im not sure kung insecure lang ako masyado so i did not try having feelings for someone out of my league, or, mababa standards ko? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\nAnd right now, may ka fling ako na nameet ko dito sa reddit and to be honest, ang rupok ko masyado na fafall ako kahit may red flags and he is giving me mixed signals...\nLord, tabang! I think i need to realize my worth huhu",

            "Initially, when me and my partner started dating I thought he was out of my league. He's at Director level, maganda sahod, maganda place niya, he has expensive hobbies and tastes.\nI guess it was a bit of an insecurity din kasi I was restarting my career when I met him. 3+ years later, we're almost at the same level na. I'm making more money than him (while in the PH), but siya naman nasa ibang bansa na right now. \nNahirapan lang ako siguro sumabay during the early days and I'm not the type to ask people to pay for my shit. He was very understanding and supportive though. We had our moments, there were a few times in those 3 years na wala siyang trabaho.",
            "Well maiiexperience ko pa lng siguro hehehe crush ko siya since grade 7 college na kami pla ngayon hehehe architecture course niya at literal na perfection siya maganda matalino maputi may sense of humor at lahat lahat na i grigreet ko siya sa birthday niya\nMag coconfess ako titingnan ko kung may chance ako heheheh",
            "Oo, pero di naging kami... kasi naman yung bahay nila ang laki! Pinakilala kasi ako non sa parents niya, as manliligaw kaya ayun nanliit ang koya mo. Di ko na tinuloy, dinaga ako eh, wala din ako maayos na trabaho that time, sapatos ko pa nun Nike na para kang may pupuntahang dance battle.",
            "Yes!  Medyo mahaba haba to, natuwa ako sa kakatyoe kasi naaalala ko nanaman ung good times dati haha\nShe was born and raised in the States, from a well-off family, very smart (nasa top 10 ng star class ng school namin) and very beautiful. . \nWe dated for four years before some circumstances led us to separating. She gave me the courage and strength to love myself and face insecurities. But in the first 2 years of our relationship, I really questioned myself. A LOT.\nFirst off, I'm not exactly what you could call physically attractive or handsome. Not from a well off family, average to low grades, napaka introvert at weeb shit lang alam. I was not particularly liked by her family nung una.\nMy mom liked her but she was afraid the difference in culture and social statuses may affect our relationship. We are pretty much polar opposites but somehow, in an odd twist, we end up dating.\nLooking back , with my personality back then, I felt that I am used up a decade of my luck to have even been close to a foreign girl let alone be in a relationship with her.\nI told her this nung nagkita kami a few years after our breakup and she was genuinely surprised na ganun pala nafeel ko that time, as she was also feeling envious that I could go out on my own, explore and eat anywhere, try a lot of things while she was sheltered and laging bantay sarado ng magulang as they weren't used to life in PH. Yun pala, di lang pala ako yung nakakaramdam ng insecurities sa difference in lifestyle and social status.\nTo sum it up.\nIt's daunting, scary, and can really drive your self esteem to the ground. Been there. I mean, Sino nga ba akong pangit at mukhang walang pagtutunguhan na sinuwerte na mainlove at makarelasyon ang isang americana di ba? haha  \nSayang na di natapos sa magandang ending yung relasyon namin. But hey, when a chapter ends another one begins. She's happily engaged in the US and practicing her dream job, while I focused on my career and hinahanap parin si \"The One\". Haha",
            "Yep. He table na in his job and financial status while im still starting my career. Eventually, he cheated on me with someone his age and same2 status in life. :)",
            "In terms of accomplishments, he was out of my league. Same uni kami pero iba yung trajectory namin sa buhay.\nFinancially I was doing better than him dahil sa family niya napupunta lahat ng pera niya. Mas nakakaafford ng luho ang family ko pero hindi halata sa itsura ko.\nNakaramdam ako na ayaw ako ng parents niya: pinagawa kami ng joint account siguro to prove na hindi ako goldigger. Saka may hiniram akong gamit sa bahay sa kanila dahil nasira yung ganon ko (isang useful item na bihira gamitin, hindi naman kamahalan at palging naka-sale sa hardware stores, normal lang hiramin ito) binawi niya agad after just one day (I think my dad was offended din at binilhan niya ako agad agad ng exact same model nung gamit na yun).\nI went and replaced him with someone na mas jologs kesa sakin. Ngayon ayoko na ng guys na mula sa big 4."

            "Nice welcome to the club!\nYou should buy at least a screen protector and a 512gb microsd to start. A case protector would be nice.\n2D games on the go are very great.\n3D games only last minutes to hours depending on the settings, so you should find a plug when playing it.\nThe sleep mod is amazing, you'll be back in your game in seconds reducing the friction of opening, booting the os, loading the game, loading the save file, which before could take around 5 minutes on my PC.\nNo need to mod it yet, play it first in default then mod it when you want it to do something.",

Yup planning on the accessories next, feel ko din need ko yung screen protector since medyo paranoid ako sa mga scratches haha but for the sd card since 512 GB yung kinuha ko i'll hold it off for now, siguro once marami na akong games na gusto ko laruin on the go\nWill also try 2D games, pero the main reason why I bought this is to play triple As anywhere haha it's just exciting, di ko madescribe\nAnd for modding, gusto ko sana try dual boot w/ windows so I can other games na hindi pa compatible, pero I'm a bit scared baka may masira ako hahaha",

            "You've gotten all bad answers here so I'll give you an actually good one. OW2 was supposed to have a PvE campaign. This was announced back in 2019 and there has been virtually no news about it since. Think something like Borderlands or L4D. Blizzard Activison management / executives thought it was a money sink so they closed the project. The content they had worked on is being repurposed into live service updates in the form of story missions that are significantly smaller in scale but still coming to the game eventually. \nLots of fans and non fans are really upset they're not getting the campaign. Devs are getting fucked because they made a very good highly profitable PvP game with almost no resources (record profits for Blizzard) that's making the people above them make the most insane irrational decisions. Cutting work from home losing them tons of important talent. Hero designers, community leads, etc. Canning projects that don't make insane ROI, after seeing how cheap they made the PvP content and still made loads of money. \nOW2 itself is still a fantastic, highly accessible, F2P hero shooter. But it will never reach its highest potential, and that's why everyone who is paying attention is so mad.",
            "Actually, the PvE was not just a campaign, it was supposed to be a full on PvE gamemode with equipment drops and talents that you would build over time and it was supposed to have a super high replay value. The whole point was to introduce an alternative to the PvP for people that liked Overwatch and wanted to do more PvE.\nIt doesn't matter if they are releasing story missions because they are not a replacement for this gamemode, sure it's wordbuilding and lore, but they have no replay value whatsoever and will occupy a few hours of your time at most. \nThe anger comes from one of the leads admitting they started shifting people and resources away from this PvE mode about a year and a half ago, meaning they knew full well they weren't gonna finish it even before the launch of OW2, but kept advertising it anyways. Lots of people only kept supporting the game with this expectation. They also used the development time for this gamemode as their excuse to leave OW1 for dead, and specified the delayed release of new Heroes on talent development and balance.\nSo OW2 may be as fantastic a game as it can be, but the devs have lost the trust of a big part of the fanbase who will not be coming back now that the content they have been supporting and waiting for turned out to be pretty much a lie.",

Being able to do several playthroughs is not at all the same as repeatable missions. (And yes I am aware Raid bosses exist in Borderlands, but they're literally just that, one boss fight)",

            "Almost 2 years na pala nung binili ko yung 2nd hand 1st car ko haha. Eto yung mga tingin ko na necessities or life changing para sakin haha\n\n\nDash Cam - no need to explain haha add ko lang siguro, buy one na dinidikit sa windshield. Unlike nung sakin na nilalagay sa rear view mirror. Iba kasi yung linaw ng rear view mirror na stock kesa pag yung sa dash cam. \n\n\nTire Inflator - Sobrang gamit and very life changing, good to have when you need it. Im using 70mai, yung medyo pa square na black\n\n\nCar Powerbank - Once or twice ko pa lang nagamit sa kotse mismo nung mamamatay na yung battery ng kotse, mas madalas pa sya nagamit sa pag tulong sa ibang kotse. And also serves as emergency powerbank din ng phones hehe. Using 70mai din dito\n\n\nLED Lights for Interiors - dati nag titiis ako ng medyo dim yung ilaw tapos buti yung tropa ko marunong mag palit ng mga ilaw ilaw, ibang iba yung liwanag sa loob nung nag palit ako ng LED haha\n\n\nLeather Seats - I think based sa kotse mo, naka leather seat na yun pero banggitin ko na din para sa iba haha. If naka cloth ka pa, eto yung bagay na sobrang worth it kasi eto yung inuupuan mo habang nagddrive ka. Wag mo din tipidin yung quality ng leather hehe \n\n\nBT Transmitter + Volt Meter + Phone Charge Port - I doubt need mo pa yung BT and etc but need mo yung volt meter just to check yung battery mo easily. But for cars na walang maayos na head unit, sobrang worth it neto nasa wala pang 200 yata bili ko. So ginagawa neto is nilalagay sa cigarette port then yung signal ng FM, dun nya ilalagay yung music from BT. Medyo mahirap iexplain but to sum it up, para to dun sa mga walang head unit na may BT for music haha. \n\n\nCigarette Port Extension - You\u2019ll need accessories and most of it is sa cigarette port kailangang ilagay. Buy 1 na may wire from cigarette port to extension para pwede mo ireroute kung san yung better place para sayo na isaksak yung accessories mo\n\n\nTools - Eto yung kinailangan ko na wala ako dati, nagka problema yung battery ko wala man lang akong wrench at liha to clean the battery ports(di ko sure tawag). Buti nasa bahay ako and buti andito tatay ko haha. Bili ka lang nung mga set wrench and dala ka lang 3M tape, liha. Etc. \n\n\nA good Jack - eto kailangan ko din pero wala pa ko, I think may kasama naman na yung sayo pero yung sakin kasi yung luma pang jack, better daw kung hydraulic haha\n\n\nDiamond Deep Dish Matting - Pros: Ang dali linisin, if may liquid na matapon, di sya sumisipsip ng liquid so pwede mo lang basta punasan so hindi rin sya mangangamoy. Ang ganda din tingnan. Cons - kitang kita yung alikabok kaya akala mo laging sobrang dumi specially if galing ka sa ulan and medyo maputik yung suot mong sapatos \n\n\nPayong - no explanation needed \n\n\nI had a ceramic done sa body kaso di ko rin maalagaan ng maintenance but good sya lalo if walang bubong parking hehe but sabi better if PPF nalang daw. But best if PPF + Ceramic :) \n\n\nBackup Sensor - Nakalagay na to nung binili ko yung kotse but this is super helpful kahit may rear camera ka na. Buy 4 of it, 2 sa rear corners, 2 sa mismong likod bandang gitna hehe. \n\n\nCar Scent - if ayaw mo na ng amoy ng bago mong kotse, team air spencer lemon/marine squash ako hahaha! \n\n\nPaper Towels + Wet Wipes - you\u2019ll never know when you need it \ud83d\ude09 haha\n\n\nExtra set of clothes - same with 15 haha\n\n\nFire Extinguisher - wala pa din ako but one of good when you need it haha\n\n\nTire pressure checker - makikita mo din naman dun sa tire inflator pero ok din yung pang check lang if in a hurry\n\n\nA small plastic / water resistant pouch for OR/CR and any docs na kailangan mo, also add some extra cash sa loob. \n\n\nMicrofiber cloths - yes, multiple haha\n\n\nI\u2019ll add more if may maisip pa ko.

The one I have doubles as a power bank. Very useful since in our tropical climate you can only expect 1-2 years lifespan for car batteries, 3 years tops. Though may delivery services naman for car batteries, hassle PA din since you have to wait for the rider Para mapaandar ung sasakyan, not to mention ang laki ng patong nila sa price and madalas no choice ka but to give in especially if you really need to get going when the battery gives up on you. Yung sa akin almost 100% ung patong nung battery delivery service when my battery died, bought a jump starter na after that. You won't use this that much, but super worth it when the need eventually arises. \n\n\nTire pressure monitoring system\n\nif your car doesn't come with one. May mga built in naman Sa newer high end models but usually indirect sensors sila, meaning they don't detect tire pressures per se but rather the imbalance a flat tire causes when running, so madalas sobrang lambot na or completely flat Na before the alarm goes off.\nwith a TPMS you can set thresholds, like if it goes below 0.4 or 0.5 above or below the threshold mag alarm Na, so that you can safely pull over to the side before the tire goes completely flat. Very useful and helpful since running completely flat is dangerous since you could have difficulty steering, not to mention could destroy your mags and your tires.\n\nNice to have lang:\n> HUD\n- if your car doesn't come with one (AFAIK Mazda lang nag offer nito built in), helpful since it keeps your eyes on the road and minimizes the need to look over the dashboard display.",

Plus kung naka ceramic coating ka di mo sya pwede pa car wash. Uubusin lang ng mga brush yung coating mo. Kelangan hand wash mo sya with smooth sponges and no rinse na shampoo. Yan ang gamit ko. Needless to say i hand wash my car kaya bibigyan mo talaga ng oras. \nPaint protection film ok sama pero di sya magcocover all the way sa body ng car. May edges sya kung san magbi build up yung dumi.

            "I am sorry but I don't like this song. Musically and lyrically its just \"meh\". It feels as if she has truly finished a \"draft\" of a song really fast recently to milk the break up topic.\nI don't think it's as catchy as her other work so it will be a skip from me. When it comes to lyrics, she can do better. She's bitter of course, it's been a long time but it's typical Taylor all over again \ud83d\ude05",
            "Agreed. I was expecting a hit punch and it felt so empty for the first real peak into the break up.",
            "Tbf I think Maroon as the gut puncher relationship song.

            "Yes I listen to her daily but I still have songs I'm not really fond of. Like for example from Reputation it's New years day or from Lover it's I think he knows. It's just a personal preference, my point is that I was expecting something more from this track and it feels as if it was done really fast to release it at the certain time.",
            "You can like Taylor, and not like every song.",
            "This song really spills a lot of information about them.\nOne thing is that it confirms what I feared was true, which is that even though many of us concluded that Bejeweled is about Calvin $\nHarris, it seems it was always mostly about Joe. I couldn\u2019t shake this sense that it was a lot more current of a mantra and to me it screamed five year relationship. \nAnd this song also makes me feel a little bit like I know why she\u2019s with Matt Healy and doing it so publicly. She is probably exhausted by the privacy kept up while in her relationship with Joe. Tired of the effort you must need to put in to keep that relationship under wraps, but to keep it private even after all these years where they\u2019re still not publicly attending award shows and talking about their lives together in interviews. It seems he always wanted to stay hidden and she never wanted it. Or maybe she did at first because she really needed a break from the tabloids wrecking her life. But it\u2019s so clear that this made things harder on them, or her and now with Matt, she\u2019s not hiding a thing. She\u2019s putting him on display in the store window that is her life, bragging about being happy, and now releasing this song saying all she wanted was to be seen by Joe and how unhappy she\u2019s become with the person this relationship has made her. I\u2019m shocked at how she\u2019s laying this out for us like this by releasing this song and doing it so immediately. She\u2019s telling us exactly what was going on and I bet that\u2019s so freeing in many ways, and also petty in others.\nI also find it really intriguing how many times on midnights she mentions her lack of intent on getting married and settling down but she mentions it here as if she does want it and he\u2019s the one who was holding back. That\u2019s really interesting. I find that a lot of women do this thing where they choose a partner they really want to marry and have a family with, but then they convince themselves they don\u2019t want that so much anymore because their partner doesn\u2019t want it. I hope she figured out what she really wants now, and I hope she gets it.",

            "I understand Joe and Taylor's relationship now and why it means to be broken. \nSee, since her discography is mainly talk about her feeling and what's going on in her life, I could assume Taylor's life has been full of anxiety, insecurity, and issues. She thought by having him by her side, those feeling would vanished completely since he saved her soul when she was at her lowest. Six years they're doing this dynamic but she still can't remove the negative feeling that clouds her mind and it makes them both exhausted.\nFrom that, my hypothesis is, he left her so she could heal properly so they could be together again and build a family in a more healthy way \ud83d\ude14",

            "personally i think she played two fan favorites and did a lot to promote karma tonight partially to distract from this track being released",
            "I don\u2019t get any villain from this. I get the sense that they were two incredibly different people. I think his calm and low key vibe probably felt really comforting and calming to her when they first met, but ultimately she is a big personality, and loves to have a dramatic and enormous life. I don\u2019t say that with shade - there is nothing wrong with wanting your life to be huge and full of excitement. \nBut when you\u2019re that kind of person, and you\u2019re with somebody who is more quiet and subdued, it can feel calming at first, but ultimately end up with you doubting your own sense of self, feeling guilty for wanting more excitement, and dulling your shine a little bit. Or a lot. I think that\u2019s why she seems so happy now, back on tour. I\u2019m sure she has moments where she\u2019s hurting, but she\u2019s back doing what she loves, and she doesn\u2019t have to hide anything now. \nTaylor seems like somebody who wants to be loved really loudly, and that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s wonderful! But it\u2019s maybe not who JA was, and so it didn\u2019t work out between them.",
            "She's giving me some narcissistic vibes with her whole \"I wanted more attention\" thing. I mean girl you're already 100 times more famous than him and he probably does less than half the projects you do in a year, if anything I'd imagine she was the one who was around less than he was",
            "She kinda did that with Jake too, like The All Too Well music video and making a big scene because Jake dropped her hand at the dinner table, and then fighting over it. Taylor honestly really needs a partner that is really intimate with her and would like having a girl by their side almost all the time and can work off them.",
            "Hard agree. Love her, but I get those vibes from 90% of her catalogue.",
            "I think that\u2019s a fair read, but attention from fans/professional is not the same as feeling seen by your partner \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nAgain - it\u2019s just interpretation, which is going to be coloured by the listener\u2019s own perspectives and experiences.",
            "I totally agree with this. I know people are heartbroken about Joe, but I have to admit I was happy she was happy\u2026 but I never expected the relationship to last as long as it did, and frankly didn\u2019t think they were a good long term match. Sure in the beginning, she needed a couple years of peace and loving someone knowing he wasn\u2019t using her was very helpful, and the pandemic was perfect for this type of relationship. But at the end of the day, Taylor is a star, she is probably the most talented entertainer of this generation, she\u2019s wanted it since she was a literal child. She lives for the applause and widespread love. I think Joe was good for what it was, but he\u2019s not her person, your people don\u2019t dull your shine.",
            "Interestingly put and I agree with most of it. The first few lines of the song to me track with what you're saying : two people who seem to think very differently about the health of their relationship.\nI think for someone of his nature there's nothing dramatically wrong with their relationship but for someone like Taylor's personality something seems off with the whole thing so much she feels it is dying. We still get no clue as to why she feels the relationship is dying (feels she lost the spark / feels there's no effort/ excitement ). I guess that's a personality/ relationship style difference",
            "Taylor has many times expressed in her songs associating big fights and dramatic makeups with love. I thought she had matured and gotten past that, but I fear she decided \"golden\" love wasn't enough. She wants the passion, not the quiet comfort. (Obviously I don't know her, this is just my interpretation of the Taylor in her music.)",

I was honestly surprised Taylor actually released this. It feels so personal and so vulnerable, like something she\u2019d write to vent her frustrations and then lock away in the vault permanently.  \nThe lyrics are so vivid and so brutal. It really captures the feeling of knowing a relationship is doomed and you\u2019re close to losing someone you love because things just aren\u2019t like they used to be and something isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s one of the most painful things to experience, especially if that person felt like your person, and this whole song highlights that pain so beautifully. It\u2019s terrible. \nIf this had been on Midnights from the start, I think it would\u2019ve been in my top 5. I\u2019m honestly a sucker for sad songs so it\u2019s not surprising but I really do love this one.

Both seem likely to me tbh. \nBut I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad song about Joe, but I get why people are wary about it being one. To me, it feels like they both didn\u2019t communicate properly, or maybe she didn\u2019t (she says she sent signals, not that she talked to him) so he didn\u2019t know anything was wrong.

He claims he\u2019s waiting to better himself, buy me a nice ring and I get that I do but he isn\u2019t doing anything to better himself or saving money to buy the ring \u201cI deserve\u201d (his words not mine). I even was like screw the rings, if we love each other let\u2019s just get married with silicone bands and he said okay!  He Never even looked at the website for the silicone bands\u2026\nAre you young? I totally believe in long relationships if you guys began dating as teens. But we were 20 and 21 when we got together, now we will be 25 and 26\u2026.. bought a house, have kids, like srsly (things we\u2019ve built so there is so much I\u2019d be giving up if I ended it). But I think it\u2019s time for me to let him go. I already act like his wife and i still beg him for the bare minimum. We did things out of order I know but its life. Now I\u2019m stuck with an impossible decision.",
            "Ahh okay, yes that's a bit of a different situation than mine!\nWell, I was 20 and he was 27 when we got together. I was very young! Now I'm 28 and he's 35. We have a house, but no kids yet. I definitely needed to grow up as I was young, and he needed to distance himself from his parents. \nIf I got pregnant, I wouldn't shut up until we'd be married. I have a thing for us ALL having the same last name. I'd be livid if he didn't propose to me (you)soon after the 1st pregnancy! Married before the 1st baby would ever be born. \nIt's sweet he says he wants to get you the ring you deserve. It really is. And I don't know how good of a job he actually has. My fiance has a good job, but I also know my ring cost under 1,000. I told him often I wouldn't care if my ring was from Walmart or whatever. But I know he got mine at Freeman Jewelers. \nYou have so much of a life with him, I honestly would not break up, especially because you have kids. \u2764\ufe0f I hope to be a mom one day too! If you truly are deeply in love with him, I probably wouldn't leave. \nI waited 7 years to get engaged. Some people thought I am nuts to have waited that long. I maybe COULD have found better (?) But what IS better? Someone who would have married me sooner, but been an abusive drunk? Or someone who would have married me sooner, but the sex isn't good or passionate?\nWe're passionate and he's not a drunk or abusive or anything. I think I've always been more afraid of finding someone worse, that i decided to never look for anyone \"better\" either. I settled down at a young age because I know there's worse, and he's honestly a sweetheart and we're good together! So I just waited. \nSee, for men, THEIR name doesn't change. He doesn't realize how strange or even embarrassing it can be for you to not all have the same last name and be married. \nSo yes, I'm not sure I'd leave, but I would be pissed about that. I've had several crying/bawling fits in the 7 years between dating and the engagement, begging him to just fucking ask me. But he always also said he wanted the \"perfect moment,\" which I do think he eventually figured it out. \ud83d\ude42 I hope I'm helping!",
            "I appreciate your point of view. I am just tired of waiting for him to be better. If he isn\u2019t better by now, I fear he never will be. I know I deserve better even if better simply means alone. I\u2019m fine with that. If I don\u2019t end up with him, I really don\u2019t care to be with anyone else. God himself would have to hand deliver me another man to get me to even look at one if things don\u2019t work out with my boyfriend. shudders still calling the man I own a home with and have children with my boyfriend. We are too old to be girlfriend/boyfriend and have too much together.",
            "Also, I am glad Taylor could bring us together and I got to hear your story. I do think sometimes men don't understand marriage being important because, I don't know I think part of it is the name change thing. \nI've always put \"Mrs. ____\" in my notebooks and stuff since I was a teenager and I had crushes or liked anyone. It's always been a fantasy of mine to be a wife and be \"his Mrs.\" and I truly hope somehow you can get it soon. You deserve it and a happy life with him! I contemplate it too and I personally don't feel I'd be better alone. What's the harm, I'm not lonely and I have my love and companion with me, whether he is my boyfriend, fiance or husband! And technically if you go back far enough, marriage didn't always exist. But I feel your pain, as I said I've had many cries and begs before the engagement happened. It hurts. It's hard. I feel you. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Yes another amazing song from her and here I am pouring my heart out. Thank you for validating this feeling. I was the same way. Like everyone in my house has the same last name. I am the only outsider and these are my kids lol this is what I call my family and I don\u2019t even have their last name\u2026.. Why is he not flattered I want his last name? I want to be Mrs. I\u2019ve always wanted to get married and have children. Now I just feel like I\u2019ve done everything wrong and I won\u2019t get the life I imagined. All bc  a man can give me a kid but not a ring and his last name. And TRUST, the kid is the BIGGER commitment. Literally tied to him\nFor life once you have children.. having a child with someone feels like a bigger commitment than marrying them but that\u2019s just me.",
            "I agree, to me the children thing hands down immediately means y'all should be married. But the age doesn't! If you're too old to not be married, what are we? Ancient? I'm 28 and he's 35! \ud83d\ude02 Yeah, I don't know what he thinks he needs to do at this point to better himself anymore. He should be specific and tell you! He's still really young if he's 25 or 26. You guys have a long way to go. You are both very young. Unfortunately I think this stuff sometimes takes time, sometimes the guy gets nervous to ask too. \nWhen mine finally proposed this past December, I said \"you knew I'd say yes! Why were you nervous!?\" And he said \"I can only do this once. It should be special and perfect.\" So there's that from a 35 year old man! Imagine the mind of one 10 years younger. You're way young. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude42\u2764\ufe0f",
            "If we didn\u2019t have kids, I\u2019d have already left him i feel like.. . I just mean we are too old to have kids and still not be married with all we share together lol. And I feel so much older bc of the kids \ud83d\ude05 they are work!! \nYour romance sounds very sweet. I thank you for sharing it with me. I feel like in your case, you did exactly what you wanted and you are happy and in love and I wish you the very best and congratulations . \ud83e\udd70",
            "Oh the things we could fix in our lives if we all could just communicate better.",
            "Obviously can\u2019t put any links but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s easily findable if you want to listen.",
            "Already heard the whole song\u2026\u2026 so sad \u2639\ufe0f",
            "\u201cDo I throw out everything we built or keep it, I\u2019m getting tired even for a phoenix\u201d ..damn\ud83d\ude2d",
            "does anyone know who produced it?",
            "Yeah it definitely sounds like Jack to me, but since the cd had no booklet I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d find out? Unless the digital copies have one",
            "Sounds Jack Antonoff to me\u2026.",
            "First off, wow that song is a true knife to the heart. Having that much vivid history and just slowly watching it fade away. Screamed to the whole world about how much she loved him just for it to end like this.  \nSecondly, I\u2019ve seen tweets from fans trying to vilify Joe but I just don\u2019t see it. The relationship came to a bitter end instead of a happy marriage. Their differences became too much to ignore. They both had their faults. We don\u2019t know that he did anything inherently bad, besides drifting apart and mentally checking out??? At worst he said he didn\u2019t want to marry her which does hurt but i\u2019d rather him do that than put her through a miserable marriage and god awful divorce. (Side note: just image what her lawyers and pr team would do).",
            "I am going through the exact same thing within my relationship of 4 years. I don\u2019t know whether to stay longer in hopes he proposes soon or just leave bc I know deep down we are STILL nowhere near marriage and idk if I even want it anymore.. ugh",
            "I waited 7 years to get engaged. Am I nuts? Some people have said so. I just...waited. I decided when we started going together when I was 20 that I didn't want to look anymore. He's THAT sweet and nice and wonderful. I've just... waited and it eventually happened. Do you think you could find someone more compatible or better for you? It's hard to say. Maybe I could find \"better,\" I know I could find worse. I don't want to look anymore. I just waited. I'm 28 now, at least we're engaged now. Hope to be married soon! \u2764\ufe0f What do you think? Are you compatible otherwise?",
            "Agree! At this stage in my life, I never want to be married. I\u2019ve never wanted to. They just aren\u2019t compatible if she wants marriage and he doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t make him nor her a bad person. Swifties sending him hate just for that make me sick",
            "I 100% don\u2019t think this was even a hit at him.  It\u2019s just the sadness of an end of a relationship that got too complacent and comfortable.",
            "This song kinda broke me today. It is super sad and the bridge is one of the most sadly beautiful things she\u2019s written. The fact she said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wanna marry me either\u201d actually really stung. I hope she finds that happiness and a man who she can marry and have a family with like she\u2019s sung about in the past \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Damn this song really makes me self-reflect a lot. I\u2019m interpreting it from the perspective of someone who asks too much of their partner that it makes them detach from the relationship. I\u2019m moody, dramatic, and I ruminate too much for my own good. The kind of of person who isolates when they are upset and desperately wants their partner to seek them out. And if they don\u2019t it feels like they don\u2019t care. But that shit is draining and it kills the love between two people. Which is why I\u2019m seeking therapy. It\u2019s nice to have a song to cry to while I think about my flaws haha.",
            "Welcome to \u2728 anxious attachment \u2728 \nIn all seriousness though, even those with anxious attachment (me too), it still requires the partner to help out and give you enough to aid your anxiety from the relationship. This song seems to say that Taylor felt he wasn\u2019t giving her enough\nThough to me this song is giving exile:\nI never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)\nI couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)\n'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)\nIt\u2019s sad :(\nEdit: I forgot to add that I\u2019m also in therapy for sometimes expecting my partner to read my mind and know things before I tell them, and grappling with what my mind is saying vs what they\u2019re actually doing. It can and HAS definitely led to some breakups. It\u2019s tough out there!! I\u2019ve definitely seen an improvement from it though <3",
            "One of the reasons this song broke my heart so much is that from what I heard, they didn\u2019t have to break up! Couples therapy and communication could potentially have made a huge difference. Relationships are hard, and I\u2019ve had many of these same thoughts in my eight year relationship - but then I learned about relationship anxiety and we went to therapy and I am so grateful we didn\u2019t throw in the towel in some of our darkest days. I know I can\u2019t assume to know their exact issues and how they addressed them, but that\u2019s just my read based on the song alone.",
            "I\u2019m hearing you!! Me and my partner broke up pretty much due to what Taylor describes (except he ended it in my situation), and we are back together now and doing so much better after I\u2019ve been to therapy to work through my issues, which seem to be similar to Taylor\u2019s in relationships.\nI can definitely see couples therapy would be amazing",
            "I wonder if they tried that? Or maybe he was so shut down that he wouldn\u2019t go. \nI could totally see Taylor leaving before trying that though. We know she has a lot of trust issues and can easily become armed in a relationship so when she feels neglected, she\u2019ll be gone so fast. \n\u201cI thought you were leading me on, packed my bags left Cornelia Street before you even knew I was gone.\u201d \nNone of that to say she didn\u2019t try very hard.",
            "Yeah, when you\u2019re the anxious one like Taylor it can be terrifying to be the one constantly bringing up issues as it feels like you\u2019re pushing away the avoidant one (seems like this was also their dynamic). It\u2019s tough when the method you use to rectify things can actually be the thing pushing them away even more. You end up feeling like you\u2019re sinking into this hole all alone and they done care. This song is very reminiscent of what I\u2019ve gone through",
            "I remember taking a course on human development and when I was reading the summary for anxious attachment I was like oh wow is this me? And then I started looking into it further and anxious preoccupied attachment was a dead ringer. I think that\u2019s why I relate to some of Taylor\u2019s songs so much. I think she might have the same attachment style \ud83e\udd72",
            "100% me too, it\u2019s really hard to disentangle what anxiety is telling you vs what your partner is actually doing. And the fine balance between getting what you need vs giving them space to be their own person with their own needs. CONSTANT BATTLE hahha",
            "I 150% thought this was a great companion to Exile. \nLike Exile is the angry part of the stages of grief and this is the depression part.",
            "They also wrote Exile together right??",
            "Who?",
            "Oh I love this take on it!  In a way it is said reflective on herself too because she never spoke the words out loud just expected him to know. \nI\u2019m so glad it made you reflect.  A really good song will do that to you.",
            "proud of you!",
            "Thank you :)",
            "I read this song the exact same way - I have a tendency to do this with my partner too and it's led to some touch and go moments in our relationship",
            "Ugh, yes been there. It\u2019s the worst. The maybe-I\u2019m-the-problem clarity afterwards brings me so much shame",
            "Oppsie \ud83e\udee3",
            "[deleted]",
            "Kanye did that just to be an asshole. Taylor's a musician who's putting out her art without naming names.",
            "Please don\u2019t compare her to Kanye after what he\u2019s done to her.  I understand your point but legit pick anyone else.",
            "The lyrics are great but the auto tune sounds horrific. It\u2019s one of her worst songs audio wise but lyrically it\u2019s beautiful.",
            "I also hate the chorus. The first line is so off haha\nBut a girl gotta spill the tea",
            "Thank god for the tea but i rlly wish she would have recorded it like hoax. Just her and the piano and a little bit of extras",
            "the song is really beautiful but the lyrics are really heartbreaking.\n\u201ci wouldn\u2019t want to marry me either\u201d line makes the marriage rumours even worse she probably wanted to get married and he didn\u2019t :(",
            "anyone else mentioned the parallel of choosing and losing with maroon??????",
            "I also noticed similarities with Maroon. \n\u201cNow, you're running down the hallway\u201d\n\u201cYou were standin' hollow-eyed in the hallway\u201d",
            "So interesting, I remember when Maroon first came out I was trying to think about which of her past relationships it could be about, but to my knowledge she\u2019s only lived with Joe (\u201cI see you every day now\u201d).  After the break up, I was like, yeah this is about Joe, that tracks. I still doubt they were totally broken up at the time of Midnights release but it\u2019s a relationship that has clearly had ups and downs like so many couples have. It\u2019s actually kind of remarkable how steady they seemed (and likely were! Just because it didn\u2019t end in marriage definitely doesn\u2019t make it a failure) to the outer public, like I\u2019m impressed with the people they surrounded themselves with?",
            "I was also trying to figure out who it could be about. \nYes. I agree.",
            "oh yeah i didn't realise that one!!",
            "I didn\u2019t at first. I was just listening to it a couple of times, thought that line was so familiar and it hit me! And Maroon is one of my favorites from Midnights.",
            "When is this coming to spotify \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
            "2025 lol",
            "You can buy the digital file on her online store now! Like $6 but I think it's limited time like through Sunday maybe",
            "probably 7 months later \ud83d\udc80",
            "The release is ridiculous. Whatever she puts out will do well no matter what",
            "Honestly the line 'stop, you're losing me' is repetitive than it needed to be. I'd like songs where she owns up her mistake too in TS11. Cuz one heart broke four hands bloody. \nShe's blaming it all on Joe with the army part. I get that's he detached but there's no way it was just him that the relationship ended.",
            "He clearly detached for a reason and anyone with a reasonable outlook will understand that this is Taylor\u2019s side of the story. It\u2019s not meant to be an unbiased telling.",
            "Obviously it\u2019s from her point of view which is definitely skewed\nI\u2019ve experienced a breakup almost exactly the same as what this song describes - and yes I got the feeling that he had completely detached and that killed me but it took me a long while to admit to myself that my own problems and anxieties quickly turned a sweet love sour, leading him to that state. I hope Taylor goes to therapy because that\u2019s where I found myself after it all. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve done that has significantly helped my relationships",
            "I interrupted it much different than blaming it all on him.  I think there is self reflection in it for the fact that she never spoke the words out loud.",
            "well the song is about him losing her so it going to be about his role why must she blame herself",
            "she doesn\u2019t have to blame herself if that not how she genuinely feels. she writes songs about her experiences. how do you know he wasn\u2019t the one to end it.",
            "what i meant was it wasn't just his part that played the role in ending a relationship. Not that he the one who dumped her.",
            "I understand what you\u2019re saying. I love when you can hear reflection in her lyrics (like Antihero or Back to December). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something a lot of people are capable of so fresh off of a breakup, so I don\u2019t think songs right now would show that kind of reflection. I bet you\u2019re right that we see it more in TS11 (unless ofc he did something truly horrible, but we don\u2019t know the details so)",
            "Very true as well.  Insight into ourselves is hard enough let alone so quickly.",
            "Is anyone suspicious of the timing of this release?",
            "Yes!",
            "No.",
            "Love the lyrics. They\u2019re just so real. Love how she added her heart beat. But not the biggest fan of the production. I think going the minimalistic route would\u2019ve worked better",
            "Jack Antonoff is her hater \ud83d\ude2d",
